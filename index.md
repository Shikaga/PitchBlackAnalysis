Antihero: Why the Riddick franchise doesn't understand itself
=============================================================

Introduction
============

Pitch Black is science-fiction horror film starring Vin Diesel. It has all the elements of a classic survival horror flick: A tough guy, a villain, lethal monsters and, of course, a disparate group of survivors waiting to be killed for the viewing pleasure of the audience. But above all this, one element stands out in the film: the character of Richard B. Riddick.

But, while Pitch Black may have all the trappings of generic horror movie, it goes far beyond that, breaking the bounds of mediocrity and becoming, in my opinion at least, a near perfect film. 

And with a successful horror movie with a strong group of core fans, a sequel cannot be far behind. After all, there are a lot of similarities between Pitch Black and Ridley Scott's horror masterpiece, Alien. And James Cameron's sequel to Alien, Aliens, is an action movie triumph. Take your main character, throw them back into the fray in a larger story with more aliens and bigger explosions, complete with nukes from orbit, and you have motion picture gold. Why can't this work for Pitch Black?

Sadly, this was not to be the destiny of the Riddick franchise. The ill conceived Chronicles of Riddick, failed at so base a level that it looked like the it would take the franchise down with it. From the plot, to the dialog, the editing, characters and villains, it is quite hard to say anything good about the film. There are perhaps a few good individual scenes, but I sure can't think of any right now.

Apparently, producers felt the same way, and it seemed like the Riddick franchise was dead in the water for the better part of a decade, as far the silver screen was concerned (although it has supposedly had a favourable run of attached video games, a rare occurance in a world of low budget video game cash ins). But Vin Diesel was not so easily deterred. Becoming an action movie star in the intervening time since Pitch Black, thanks in large part to the Fast and Furious franchise now going into it's seventh incarnation, Vin Diesel sunk his own money into producing another sequel.

In the third film, simply called "Riddick", Vin Diesel reprises his role in what is by and large a remake of Pitch Black. Gone is the convoluted world building and supernatural plot lines. A back to basics Riddick vs the Elements film tries to exploit what made Pitch Black so good, and while it doesn't quite stick the landing, it was a good effort. 

But why? What is it that makes Pitch Black so good, Chronicles so bad and Riddick mediocre at best?


Part 1: Hero
============

"They say most of your brain shuts down in cryosleep. All but the primitive side. The animal side. No wonder I am still awake"

Richard B. Riddick
------------------

To truly understand the Riddick franchise, we need understand its core, Richard B. Riddick

In the first twenty four words, Pitch Black tells you more about the character of its protagonist than most films do in their entire three acts. These immortal lines hook the audiences attention immediately. Who is this character that is somehow unaffected by Cryosleep? who refers to himself as a wholly "primitive animal"?

A confessed murder, Riddick is a total badass. Muscled, bald, supremely competent and arrogant, he is the very definition of an action movie hero.

The alpha male sensibilities that Riddick exudes provide a great deal of wish fulfilment for men. He is simultaneously feared and idolised. When he talks people listen, and when he says jump, people ask how high. The audience watches his every move, and his "bad guy with a heart of gold", persona makes him almost impossible to predict, and we are constantly guessing what he is going to do next.

Most traditional protagonists will move heaven and earth, usually by some deus ex machina, to protect those in their care (usually a female love interest). A typical example of this "white knight cliche" would be an antagonist capturing the love interest, at which point the hero will drop their weapons, and allow themselves to get captured to save the one they love. Shortly after they will escape and save the day.

The Riddick portrayed in Pitch Black is not one of these protagonists. He does what he can to save the other crew members, but he is pragmatic, never expecting a deus ex machina to help him save everyone in the face of impossible odds. This realism combined with his bleak outlook on life, and of course standard action movie trappings of witty one liners and a never say die attitude, makes him a very interesting character. 

And so we, like Jack in the movie, fall into a sort of hero worship of Riddick. And yet, this hero worship is the very downfall of Riddick franchise, for the writers of the Chronicles of Riddick, likewise fell in love with their character. And not unlike the internet's Chuck Norris Facts, his actions became grander with every retelling. 

But before we start to talk about Chronicles, let us have a analyse the character of Riddick in Pitch Black

Alpha Male
----------









Riddick is clearly the salient threat, the antagonist of a would be slasher film. Between his opening monologue and Johns doomsaying, we are given the impression that Riddick is a death dealing machine, that wouldn’t hesitate to “skullfuck you in your sleep”.

Even in chains in his opening dialogue exchange with Fry he is clearly in control. Of course, he has somehow been captured. But we have all been here before. The villain getting captured as part of his grand plan was a little less hackneyed in 2000, but has always been a classic trope of genre films.

And yet, this never seems to come to pass. Did he know that Johns would release him? Did he know that the only way that he would be able to get off the planet would be to travel with the rest of the passengers, allowing them to get picked off one by one, thus requiring him to get captured?

Indeed, it would not have been hard for to add a line of dialog for it to be so,

> RIDDICK: “Come on Carolyn. You think I helped you out of the goodness of my heart?” LAUGHS Fry shakes her head, visibly upset. 
> RIDDICK: “I couldn’t make it all the way myself, I needed a distraction. That’s all you were to me Fry. Big, fat, juicy distractions” SMILES EVILY

And yet, this is not the Riddick that we are given in this movie. His role as antagonist does not outlive the first act. In fact, upon reflection, his actions of the first act are not conducive to an antagonist role when taken in context. Sure, he tried to incapacitate Johns in a bid to escape. But beyond that he doesn’t seem to bear any ill will to any of the crewmembers, even Johns.

His stalking of Fry seems to have been simply out of curiosity. He did not kill (the gravedigger).

The film definitely tries to give you the sense of his danger in the first act, but he never actually seems to provide a threat.

That is not to say that he is a saint. He tries to help the other passengers, but only to a degree. When one of the Imam’s boys gets cornered by a creature, Riddick does not try to save him. He tells the boy to stay still, but when the boy runs, Riddick does nothing to intervene, clearly sensing the futility of trying to save boy.

Johns in fact, posses a far more salient threat to the survivors. Johns is selfish. We know this because he has a drug problem, and all junkies are evil. He was more than willing to kill Jack to save his own life, and he is fixing to betray Riddick from the moment that he frees him.

Yet, despite Riddick often displaying cowardice and weakness, he still ends up being incredibly likeable. THis is largely due to the fact that he still lives by a code.

It is because he performs acts that are unconscionable for a protagonist. When forced, he leaves Fry, Abu and Jack to die on the planet while he heads to safety. This makes Riddick seem like a hypocrite. 

When Johns decides to sacrifice Jack to get the rest of the group to the ship, Riddick dispatches him. Yet shortly after, Riddick abandons all the survivors to escape by himself.

Why is it that the audience forgives him for this? On one hand, it is because he is a survivor, and we respect that.


In many ways, this makes more sense. Indeed, Fry is very much of a Ripley character. She is competent, strong, treated as an equal by the rest of her crew. She is also eminently pragmatic. 



Well, maybe. He is after all, the most memorable character. Everyone walks out of the film, thinking "Man, that Riddick was a badass!", and it is true that he is.

But while Riddick may be the protagonist, he is simulataneously also the antagonist. And this is where the character of Riddick becomes most interesting.

By fulfilling both protagonist and antagonist role, he can suddenly do no wrong in the eyes of the audience. We love him when he is good, and we love him all the more when he is bad.


???
---

Riddick is not without emotion, at least not in Pitch Black. 

He is prone to fits of anger. When Johns frees Riddick, he tells Riddick to "remember this moment. The way it could have gone and didn't". Riddick is visibly annoyed, and lashes out. He snatches Johns' rifle from his hand, "Fuck you!", he says threatening Johns, "I want you to remember this moment".

Riddick should have kept his cool, graciously accepted Johns' phony treaty and waited his time, but instead he tries, unsuccesfully, to restore the balance of power in his favour, posturing that merely earns a grin from Johns.

He is clearly a troubled individual. His talk about his disdain for God, the long time he spent in prison and the fact that his mother supposedly abandoned him at birth, all point to a character who feels betrayed by life.

He clearly harbours an emotional separation from the other characters, not being able to empathise with them the way a normal character would. 

Riddick shows variable loyalty the rest of the crew. He clearly fancies himself as a stone cold killer, and tries to portray himself as such before the other characters. He delight's in their naiveté, and laughs at their collective misfortune.

His ire fall's most heavily on Abu, The Holy Man. Riddick sees his belief as a weakness. "So where the hell's your God now?", he asks mockingly as the sudden rainfall starts to extinguish their last remaining torches.

But Riddick is not a sadist, or without reason. He does try to get the entire crew to safety. He defends Jack against Johns, when Johns tries to betray her, and he continues to shepard them to safety.

The scene in which Fry arrives at the ship just in time to prevent Riddick from leaving without them is the climax of the film. It is where, we finally see precisely what our two main characters are made of. 

Each of them has made it to safety against incredible odds, and the prospect of going back for the remaining two survivors suddenly seems like an impossible task.

> RIDDICK: "Strong survival instinct. I admire that in a woman"
> FRY: "I promised them, that we would go back with more light"
> RIDDICK: "Did you? Hmmm"
> FRY: "What? Are you afraid?"
> RIDDICK: "Me afraid?" LAUGHING

But Riddick is afraid. He doesn't think that he can do it. He already abandoned them once, when he decided to leave them at the last mile. Riddick is not a villian, he did not string his fellow passengers only to abandon them out of some kind of sadistic game. He truly believed he was too weak to save them, and his own survival instinct made him take the pragmatic approach.

When Fry tries to convince him to save the others, he simply counters with offering to take her with him, knowing it would be suicide, and that Fry is too clever to do otherwise.

> RIDDICK: "You don't know anything about me. I will leave you here"
> FRY: "I can't. I can't" CRYING
> RIDDICK: "Sure you can, here I will make it easy on you

Riddick stretches out his hand

> RIDDICK: "Take my hand, Come on, Come one"
> RIDDICK: "Look, no one is going to blame you Carolyn"
> RIDDICK: "Come on, Come on, That's it, That's it. Good Girl"

In this scene, Riddick is trying to get Carolyn to also take the cowards way out. He clearly thinks that if she too, abandons the others, then he is no more guilty that any other pragmatic individual.

He asks her to come aboard, offering his hand, and coaxing her onboard with gentle words and nudges, to overcome her emotional paralysis. This scene is truly incredible, Fry finally breaking down, weeping in the rain as she slowly resolves to leave the other to her face, while Riddick comforts her.

But then Fry's personal journey finally resolves. She determines that she would rather face death, even certain death, than leave any of her crew to die. She is able to rectify her mistake, to forgive herself for trying to purge the passenger hold.

> FRY: "Now, you! You listen to me! I am the captain of this ship. And I am not leaving anyone on this rock"

> RIDDICK: "You would die for them?"
> FRY: "I would try for them"
> RIDDICK: "You didn't answer me"
> RIDDICK: "Yes I would Riddick, I would. I would die for them"

Riddick takes off his goggles. A beat

> RIDDICK: "How interesting"

It is in this moment that Riddick is a most interesting character. He has seen something that he can't explain. For Fry to selflessly go back for the others, even without Riddick's help intrigues him.

They save the other crew members, but Riddick is griviously hurt and alone, and it is subsequently Fry's responsibility to save him. 

FRY: "I said I would die for them. Not you"

Fry helps Riddick back to his feet, but while helping him back to the ship, she dies herself.

It is difficult to know what the character of Riddick feels at this moment. He seems to blame himself, but it is quite possible that he would let her take the blame for her own actions. He did warn her of the dangers of such a selfless act, and she declared that she was willing to die for them.

He allows himself a moment to grieve, but once again, he tries to embody his persona of "stone cold killer", by the time that he once again joins the rest of the crew. What this says about his character, is as much a reflection of viewers feeling as Riddick's, but it is clear that he is not unnaffected by her death.

And while Riddick is not an emotionless robot, nor is he an unstoppable killing machine. Indeed, in this regard, in the sequel, The Chronicles of Riddick it seems like he is a completely different character. 

In Pitch Black he is frequently bested by the rest of crew. When he first escapes, John's is able to take him down, despite Riddick getting the drop on him (albeit, while shackled). And after he escapes, he is once again captured by crew, when they work together.

Nor does he have the usual prescience of a movie hero. He frequently misjudges both his enemies and his allies. When cornered by the creatures, he runs towards the rest of the crew, not predicting that they would instinctively shine light in his eyes. I have almost never seen such a trivial mistake made by a movie hero, and it imbues Riddick with a certain sense of believablity.

"It looks clear"

In addition, we can assume that John's was able to track down and capture Riddick by his skill as a bounty hunter.

Not only that, but he is beaten to the point of near unconciousness by a mere two creatures, who have already shown themselves to not be particularly dangerous, relatively speaking. He needs Fry to save him after his battle, and is so weak, that he is not even capable of saving her.

By contrast, the Riddick presented to us in Chronicles, is an unstoppable killing machine, who is able to take down crew after crew of highly skilled mercenaries unarmed, dangerous convicts with nothing more tin cup and necromancer Gods with a simple dagger.

He infiltrates Crematoria without any apparent doubt that not only he, but also Jack, will be able to subsequently break out. Yet in Pitch Black, Riddick states that he spent half of his life in his previous "slam". In fact, we are informed that he was only able to escape by hijacking a prison transport, we have no reason to believe that he is a man that no prison can hold. 

This is sadly one of the common mistakes that all sequels seem to be prone to. Once your hero has defeated one enemy, they need to be given a bigger test. This is why a New York City cop who's initial actions are initially to call the police, is only three movies later blowing up a helicopter with a car and surfing a jet.

It seems impossible for films to let a character be anything less than a superhero by the time their second movie comes around. Even Alien is not completely immune to this, with with the Ripley from Aliens being significantly more badass than her previous incarnation.

That is not to say that the Riddick presented in Pitch Black is weak. He shows himself to be supremely competent, but he never quite stops being human. 











Part 2: Villain
---

A discussion about how the Riddick in Pitch Black is just as much a force of nature in the first film as the aliens that he dispatches. He is good because he is not in focus too much of the time, letting other characters largely carry the plot.



























Part 3: Cannon Fodder


There are many comparisons to be made with Alien. Both film's feature largely on female protagonists. Both movies involve getting stalked in the dark by aliens. Both movies feature largely civilian crew members. 

For any movie about killer space monsters, parallels must be drawn to Alien. Consider:

In Alien, a [greedy crew member] brings a dangerous alien on board in an attempt to get rich. The Alien escapes, and then slowly hunts down each of the crew members in turn while the crew, headed by Ripley, try to track it down.

By contrast, in the first half of Pitch Black, John's brings a dangerous being on board in an attempt to get rich. Riddick escapes, and then (we are lead to believe) slowly hunts down each of the crew members in turn while the crew, led by Fry, try to track him down.

A forced analogy? Maybe. But there is no question that in the first half of Pitch Black, before we truly understand the danger posed by the flying creatures, the audience is forced to see Riddick as the salient threat of the film.

It is interesting, if you were to rewrite the movie, thirty minutes in, how different it could have gone.

Who is the protagonist of Pitch Black? What do we expect from our protagonists? Courage, strength, intelligence? Quick one-liners?

Perhaps, all we need for someone to be a protagonist is for the audience to identify with them, to see the world from their point of view. Indeed, there are plenty of stories out there about anti-heroes, who we identify with and are undoubtedly the protagonists of their own films.

But can Riddick, who does not utter a single line of dialog for the first twenty seven minutes of the film, possibly be considered the film's protagonist? Is he the character that the audience most sympathise with?

It would not have been hard, for a writer to pick up the film after forty five minutes and turn it into a standard Freddy or Jason style slasher, with perhaps just one of the crew members escaping with the escape ship (with a cut of Riddick hiding in the engine bay for the stinger).

But this is not the direction the film chooses to take. It instead becomes much more interesting. Johns makes a deal with Riddick: help them, guide them, and he will get his freedom.

But before we discuss the rest of the film, let us look where we are after twenty seven minutes.

The first act is unquestionably Carolyn Fry's movie. 

The film starts, with her waking up from cryosleep in the midst of a disaster. While the her co-pilot Owens is still reeling from his sudden awakening, she is immediately into action, trying to land the ship.

She is then immediately confronted with an "action movie choice". With the ship crashing, she prepares to purge the passenger cabin. Owens talks her down, telling her that he has every confidence in her to be able to land the ship.

However, with ship still spinning out of control she attempts to purge the cabin anyway, but Owens has sabotaged the system, so that she is forced to try and land the ship intact.

It is at this point that we see the character Fry is, both in herself, and how she is reflected in Owens. 

She had the ability to land the ship, and Owens believes in her enough to entrust his own life into her hands. But she does not.

Is she merely being selfish, being willing to abandon people she doesn't know in a bid to save herself and her colleague? Perhaps, but she is also clearly pragmatic. In her mind, they are all going to die, and she is willing to make the sacrifices to save those she can.

This is often the kind of opening scene a movie would use to set up their main character. Perhaps this was a flashback, and she has since been rescued is now currently unable to forgive herself for trying to sacrifice all those people. One logical thing to do now, would be to cut to her waking up screaming in bed, before suddenly realising that she was just reliving her nightmare. Pan over to the futuristic alarm clock, showing that it is 3:34 in the morning, but never mind going back to sleep, Carolyn is going to wake up and brood. 

But fear not, soon an old friend calls her. They need a brilliant pilot. She says that she doesn't do that anymore. Ever since… "You can't blame yourself for that Carolyn, you did what you had to do." After a little bit of backstory, and perhaps a hint of past romance, she decides to at least listen to the offer. They get dinner in a shady diner with a shady backer, and after enough exposition, we are off on a good science fiction romp.

Instead, Pitch Black continues. Fry quickly assesses the damage, gathers to survivors and addresses the "Riddick problem". A lot of time is put into her emotion, and feelings at this point in the film. The guilt that she feels for Owens' death, not to mention trying to kill the rest of passengers.

She clearly doesn't have much motivation to do anything, but she still soldiers on, perhaps her military training kicking in. She organises the search for water and talks to Johns about the best way to deal with Riddick. She doesn't become overly demanding, or try and pull rank, and we genuinely like her.

At the same time, the movie pauses long enough on the rest of the characters for us to get to like them. At this point in the movie, we are setting up for Friday 13th style slasher, and it is already clear that not everyone is going to make it off this planet.

But unlike most Friday 13th style movies, most of these characters are quite likeable and believable. Rather than thin stereotypes (???, The Jock, The Whore, The Clown and The Virgin as so eloquently stated in Cabin in the Woods), we get well rounded characters, each with their own motivations and abilities. 

This is in many ways, what Pitch Black does best. You actually want all these characters to survive. Sure, you came to the movie to see the awesome kills, and you want your money's worth, but humanising these people only helps the movie.

Abu, the Imam, is one of the most interesting of these. In addition to being one of the few survivors, his paternal care of his acolytes brings a sense of a family to the film, without needing the inevitable "father's vengeance". 

He clearly cares a lot for his kids, but trusts in his God as they slowly and mercilessly get killed one by one. Perhaps he sees himself as a Job figure, seeking meaning in his punishment. Perhaps not.

But it is also this religious aspect that adds a good deal of depth to the film. The Imam finds himself in the company of atheists, who gently discount his faith (???, Is this true?). 

But it is when he is discussing God with Riddick that the film becomes most interesting. Indeed, Riddick claims to believe in some kind of God figure, laying much of his trouble at his feet. Whether this is a true belief or merely social construct that Riddick uses to explain the bad things that happen in this world, is known only to him however.

But the Imam's constant Faith is something that Riddick starts to admire. When the rain starts to fall, Riddick asks "So where the hell's your God now?". But shortly after, when Carolyn convinces Riddick to save them, the Imam finally says, "There is my my God, Mr Riddick", to which Riddick simply smiles in acknowledgement.

Yes, that sentence can be interpreted two ways, but I think it can simply be taken as the Imam trying to say that God has a plan for Riddick.

As they finally fly into the sunset, the Imam acknowledges, that he "There is so much prayer to make up for, I scarcely know where to begin", Jack replies, "I know where I would start".

I never did really understand what Jack meant in this scene. The best I can guess is that she meant that she would than God for Riddick, but if anyone has a better idea I would love to hear it.

This brings up the character of Jack. A young girl travelling alone, masquerading as a boy, she has a hero worship of Riddick. 

Jack quickly fashions replicas of Riddick's trademark goggles, and runs around the ship terrorising the rest of the crew, in ways on children can, until one passenger finally quips, "Did you run away from your parents or did they run away from you?"

Jack is very believable and never annoying as young characters in these movies so often are. 

In the scene where Riddick and Fry are talking about (??? Name's) disappearance, Jack enters and starts asking about Riddick's eyes. This is a wonderful bit of exposition, and a chance for Jack to show her fascination with Riddick, and the secret of his surgical sine job which is so poorly executed on in the following film.

Jack's gender is a secret kept from both the characters and the audience well into the film. When the crew must pass the most dangerous point in their journey Riddick halts the group, stating that it will be impossible to go any further, "Especially with the girl bleeding."

Jack also has a crucial role to play later in the film, where Johns decides to ask Riddick to "triage" Jack to save the rest of the group. Why precisely Johns would make this offer isn't exactly clear. Perhaps he doesn't understand Riddick very well. But Riddick quite clearly states that there is a line that he won't cross and Johns flew way over it.

After dispatching Johns, Riddick returns to the group, informing them of what happens. When Jack starts to get upset about losing him, Riddick simply says, "Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare".

The other characters, while minor roles, are still very likeable. None of them really conform to typical stereotype roles, and they all have a little bit to contribute to the film. While inevitable, you do feel a little sorry for each of them as they are dispatched, albeit normally at their own hands for not doing as they are told.





























Solution

A discussion about how a sequel to a movie like Pitch Black can best be executed. Can it?




How then, do you create a sequel to a movie like Pitch Black? Well it seems that Vin Diesel seems to think that you do it by remaking it within it's own continuity. And is he wrong?

Not really. Riddick is a good film, all things considered. It quickly jettison's the extraneous Necromonger plot lines alla Alien 3, and adds a family member bent on revenge for his family member that Riddick killed in the first film, alla Die Hard with a Vengeance.

The film is heavy handed in its use of repetition, both of plot points and shots. In many ways it is these scenes that are the best in the movie.

What about the "superhero effect"? Yes, it is there. The Riddicck in Riddick is significantly more powerful than his counterpart in Pitch Black. But it is not quite to the same degree that Chronicles go to. 

This Riddick can be hurt. He makes mistakes. He gets captured. And in the final "climax" of the film, he even needs too be saved by his enemies.

There are many problems with the "Riddick". For starters, the film really needs to have it's dialog almost completely rewritten from scratch.

In addition, non of the character's motivations make any sense. Every single one of the bounty hunters is supposedly here to kill Riddick, and yet they never do it, despite the many opportunities that they have.

The addition of the "cells" plotline goes a long way to fixing this issue. Obviously they cannot kill him once he has hidden the cells somewhere in the desert, but why does Johns save him at the end? He only moments before abandoned Riddick to take both power cells back to the ship, and yet something in the last half and hour or so has made him change his mind so that he now needs to save Riddick?



Why does thug number 1 suddenly attack Johns when Riddick is digging? Surely you would kill Riddick first, and why would you even try and kill Riddick? Every single person in the film who has crossed him so far has died! Leave him alone.




Also, unlike Pitch Black, nearly every single one of the characters is completely unlikable. One of Pitch Black's strong points was the fact that most of the characters were actually quite likeable. None of the characters were over the top cliches. Even Johns, as flawed as he is, acted more like a scared chid than a action villain stereotype.

You genuinely want all the characters in Pitch Black to make it through. The same can not be said of Riddick. Every single one of the characters is completely unlikable.

You have absolutely no empathy for any of the characters that die, and no joy for those who live. In Pitch Black, when Jack and Abu escape the planet with Riddick, you feel genuinely relieved for them, and feel a very real sense of pain that Fry didn't make it.

You do not feel the least thing for these characters. They have all backstabbed and bitched and postured the whole movie, and you can't help but think the movie would be better without them.

In fact, have there ever been non-protagonist bounty hunters or mercenaries that the audience has ever empathised with? There is a whole sub population of society that the film industry has completely marginalised as evil greedy cannon fodder. I have known a few mercenaries in my time, and they have been lovely people, no worse than any national military solider. But while soldiers get to get shot holding a picture of their girlfriends while Adagio for Strings plays, mercenaries get gunned down with gleeful abandon, without ever a thought that perhaps this person was only on this job in an attempt to put food on table for their family.

Nevertheless, it is not the job of "Riddick" to try and reverse this trend. Simply be aware of it, and realise that the audience is not going to sympathise with mercenaries the way it is going to empathise with the survivors of the Hunter Gratzner.

And on the subject of empathising, a dog, seriously? Don't get me wrong, the dog was one of the better parts of the film. Firstly the, CG on it was excellent, about as good as I have seen. That said, it never stops being a CG dog. Vin Diesel is just able to act as though there is a real dog there. There is something about the way that people's eyes move when they are looking at a creature, that is completely lost, and just makes me feel like I am sitting on a sterile set whenever he and the dog are sharing a scene.

But anyone who has been around the film block for a while, could have told you that the dog was not long for this world. "Evil people kill dogs", is one of the biggest tropes in Hollywood, and it seems as though the film wants to villainise Santana much more for the killing of a dog who was attack him, than for the rape and murder of a woman at the beginning of the second act.


"Ball's deep"? What the fuck? Since when does a hero threaten a woman with rape? Okay, technically, all he implied was that he would have sex with her, not that it would it would be non-consensual. But the character was pre-established to be homosexual (which I will come back to later). To imply that Riddick's action's over the next twenty four hours would be such that she would change her sexual orientation, is simply adolescent male (read: Vin Diesel) wish fulfilment.

And why does her character even need to be a lesbian? It seems to me to be a real shame that it seems like no woman can possibly be tough in movies or television, without being a lesbian. This is not really the forum for this discussion, but seriously..

On the subject of homosexuality, I think it would have been much more interesting if it had turned out that John's had been John's husband rather than father.

Indeed, I though that the film was setting up for this. John's never implies that he is the father, Riddick induces it, and Johns never confirms nor denies it. Then later in the film, Riddick inform's Johns that his son was a junkie to which Johns Sr replies, "That is no the man I knew". Do father's refer to their son's as "the man I knew". Sure. But they are much more likely to say something like, "He was a good kid". This would have been a perfect juncture to reveal that Johns Sr was actually Johns husband.

The shock that your husband was a drug addict and you never knew about it, is so much more visceral than that your son is a drug addict. There are ten thousand movies about men's son's doing drugs and their father saying "you are going to ruin your life if you go down this path son".

But there are precious few films about how discovering that your partner is a drug addict can destroy your life. This would have been a far more interesting story. Firstly, it personalises the original Johns much more. You never think about the fact that he has a family or loved ones. It never occurs to you that he might be so viciously hunting Riddick's bounty because he has a husband to provide for

And I think that discovering that your Husband is was a drug addict is just so much more potent. Johns would have had to completely rethink their relationship. All those little things would suddenly start to make sense, as they always do. Ultimately it would make no difference, he would love him just as much.

finally, it would mean that the actor wouldn't look way to young to be Johns father. Ten years have passed since the events of Pitch Black. Taking that into account, Both Johns are about the same age, so I can only suppose that Johns Sr has had some serious work done. Perhaps he exchanged twenty menthol kools for a surgical face lift.


















The first film, Pitch Black, is a film about survival, about many characters working together to survive the elements. In many ways, Riddick is just just one of those characters.

a character who never became much more than human. 

It is often difficult to consider Pitch Black as it's own film, so intertwined is the Riddick legend with sequels and video games. But even a person who has only watched Pitch Black will likely come out of the movie with the impression of "badass", on their minds, which is likely only going to grow over time.



But is this an accurate representation of Riddick, and is it the reason that Pitch Black is a good movie and Riddick a great character?









He is not necessarily main character, he doesn't even have the most screen time. 

But, by the end of the film, there is no doubt that Riddick is the hero of this piece. And it is upon this foundation that the Riddick franchise was built, including multiple films, video games and even anime.

But, while ostensibly Riddick may have escaped the planet at the end of Pitch Black, in many ways his character, his character never did. 


With his first line of dialog, Riddick steals the movie right from under her.








Can Hollywood create a trilogy about a character that is anything less than a superhero responsible for saving the universe?

Popular films leave their audiences with a deep seated affection for their heroes. A sequel is the natural way to capitalise on this. But a character needs a bigger challenge on their second visit to the silver screen, which must once again be amplified for the third. This continues until the once beloved character bears no longer resemblance to his earlier self (See Jason X aka Jason in Space). 

Die Hard came close. The first three Die Hard films remain within the bounds of reality. However, things swiftly go downhill with Die Hard 4.0 (Live Free or Die Hard), with the character of John McLain being almost unrecognisable, as he is soon blowing up helicopters with cars and surfing jets (seriously not making this up, watch the movie). By the fifth film, the character simply has no limits anymore.

And it is these limits, that form focus of our discussion.







Who is this character who then goes on to describe, with remarkable detail, right down to the leather tool belt, his fellow passengers, presumably by smell alone?

 John McClane, begins his narrative journey as a police officer and deadbeat husband, a believable everyman who is thrust into events beyond his control. But before long, John McClane turns into John Rambo on steroids. In many ways, the Die Hard series achieved more than most, it was actually capable of putting together a solid trilogy before succumbing to inevitable Hollywood money making machine. 


??? Move the rest of this down to somewhere more appropriate.

While I am personally not a fan of Die Hard 2, by and large it remains believable (relatively speaking), and apart from a bit of nudging the fourth wall ("Why does this keep happening to us?", "Not again"), the characters remain in their own world. Die Hard: With a Vengance, does a much better job. By losing the fourth wall and pairing John up with an entertaining sidekick, Die Hard 3 feels like a perfect sequel. John is no more powerful than he was in Die Hard one, and his motivation and circumstances are believable.

But in a way what is most tragic about Die Hard 4.0 is that it is actually a great movie. It would have fit in perfectly as a Brosnan era Bond film, or some equally slapstick action flick. But it is not a good Die Hard film, because the character has no limits.

Die Hard is supposed to be about about a New York Cop, doing the best he can in the situation. In Die Hard, when terrorists attack Nakatomi Plaza, his first action, is to run away from danger. He then tries to call the police; the phone lines are cut. He then pulls the fire alarm, and the call is diverted. He then takes down ONE terrorist, and uses his radio to call for help. Once police assistance arrives, he hides in the bathroom, until he suddenly realises that the roof has been rigged with explosives, forcing him to try to save hostages.

At every junction his choices are quite logical and believable for his character. And this continues, by and large, for the next two films. But soon Hollywood require another movie, to capitalise on a much loved character, and quickly start looking around the back shelves for an action movie plot. 

Any will do, with a flick of a red pen John McLain quickly becomes a protagonist, complete with catchphrase and references to previous films. The fact that his character has suddenly become superhuman badass is irrelevant.



Our story begins aboard the Hunter Gratzner, where Richard B. Riddick is being transported in cryosleep back to the prison by bounty hunter William Johns. After a midflight incident, the pilot Carolyn Fry crash lands the ship on a planet. Their ship is badly damaged, but the soon find another ship with which they can escape the planet. But their troubles are not yet over, as the planet is infested with dangerous flying creatures and it is up to Riddick, Fry, Johns and the rest of the passengers to escape.
