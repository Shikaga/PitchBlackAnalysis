Pitch Black, Alien and why the Riddick franchise doesn't understand itself
---

"They say most of your brain shuts down in cryosleep. All but the primitive side. The animal side. No wonder I am still awake"

In the first twenty four words, Pitch Black tells you more about the character of Riddick than most films do in their entire three acts.

And yet, this is the very downfall of Riddick franchise.

There are many comparisons to be made with Alien. Both movies feature largely civiliant crew members dealing dangerous Aliens. Both film's feature largely on female protagonists.

"Don't you touch that handle Fry!"

What was it that made Pitch Black much better than The Chronicles of Riddick? It is so easy to chalk it up to Chronicles being yet another "unnecessary sequels", that w

The Protagonist

Who is the protagonist of Pitch Black? What a silly question you say, Riddick of course!

Well, maybe. He is after all, the most memorable character. Everyone walks out of the film, thinking "Man, that Riddick was a badass!", and it is true that he is.

But while Riddick may be the protagonist, he is simulataneously also the antagonist. And this is where the character of Riddick becomes most interesting.

By fulfilling both protagonist and antagonist role, he can suddenly do no wrong in the eyes of the audience. We love him when he is good, and we love him all the more when he is bad.

But let me propose an alternative. Consider that perhaps Fry is the protagonist.

In many ways, this makes more sense. Indeed, Fry is very much of a Ripley character. She is competent, strong, treated as an equal by the rest of her crew. She is also eminently pragmatic. 

The opening scene in which she attempts to purge the passenger cabin. Owens has every confidence that she is able to save everyone on board, even though Fry does not.

Yes of course, Riddick. He is what we all came here to see isn't it?

Well, no. At least, not in 2000 when Pitch Black was released. Sure, he is what we all left the cinema remember, but he was not the reason we came to see the movie. In the painfully nineties trailer, Riddick is as an incidental character at best.

Riddick is not without emotion, at least not in Pitch Black. 

He is prone to fits of anger. When Johns frees Riddick, he tells Riddick to "remember this moment. The way it could have gone and didn't". Riddick is visibly annoyed, and lashes out. He snatches Johns' rifle from his hand, "Fuck you!", he says threatening Johns', "I wan't you to remember this moment".

Riddick should have kept his cool, graciously accepted Johns' phony treaty and waited his time, but instead he tries, unsuccesfully, to restore the balance of power in his favour, posturing that merely earns a grin from Johns.

Nor is he an unstoppable killing machine. Indeed, in this regard, in the Chronicles of Riddick it seems like he is a completely different character. 

In pitch black he is frequently bested by the rest of crew. When he first escapes, John's is able to take him down, despite Riddick getting the drop on him (albeit, while shackled). And after he escapes, he is once again captured by crew, when they work together.

Nor does he have the usual prescience of a movie hero. He frequently misjudges both his enemies and his allies. When cornered by the creatures, he runs towards the rest of the crew, not predicting that they would instinctively shine light in his eyes. I have almost never seen such a trivial mistake made by a movie hero, and it imbues Riddick with a certain sense of believablity.

"It lookes clear"


In addition, we can assume that John's was able to track down and capture Riddick by his skill as a bounty hunter.

By contrast, the Riddick presented to us in Chronicles, is an unstoppable killing machine, who is able to take down crew after crew of highly skilled mercenaries unarmed, dangerous convicts with nothing more tin cup and necromancer Gods with a simple dagger.

This is sadly one of the common mistakes that all sequels seem to be prone to. Once your hero has defeated one enemy, they need to be given a bigger test. This is why a New York City cop who's initial actions are initially to call the police, is only three movies later blowing up a helicopter with a car and surfing a jet.

It seems impossible for films to let a character be anything less than a superhero by the time their second movie comes around. Even Alien is not completely immune to this, with with the Ripley from Aliens being significantly more badass than her previous incarnation.

That is not to say that the Riddick presented in Pitch Black is weak. He shows himself to be supremely competent, but he never quite stops being human. 


Twenty seven minutes. This is how long it is before Riddick has his first line of dialogue.
