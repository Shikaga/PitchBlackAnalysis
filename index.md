Survival Instinct: Why the Riddick franchise doesn't understand itself
=============================================================

Introduction
============

*Pitch Black* is science-fiction horror film starring Vin Diesel. It has all the elements of a classic survival horror flick: A tough guy, a villain, lethal monsters and, of course, a disparate group of survivors waiting to be killed for the viewing pleasure of the audience. But above all this, one element stands out in the film: the character of Richard B. Riddick.

But, while *Pitch Black* may have all the trappings of generic horror movie, it goes far beyond that, breaking the bounds of mediocrity and becoming, in my opinion at least, a near perfect film. 

And with a successful horror movie with a strong group of core fans, a sequel cannot be far behind. After all, there are a lot of similarities between *Pitch Black* and Ridley Scott's horror masterpiece, *Alien*. And James Cameron's sequel to *Alien*, *Aliens*, is an action movie triumph. Take your main character, throw them back into the fray in a larger story with more aliens and bigger explosions, complete with nukes from orbit, and you have motion picture gold. Surely the same will work for *Pitch Black*?

Sadly, this was not to be the destiny of the Riddick franchise. The ill conceived *Chronicles of Riddick*, failed so completely that it looked like it would tank the entire franchise. From the plot to the dialog, the editing and the special effects, not to mention the characters and villains, it is quite hard to say anything good about the film. There are perhaps a few good individual scenes, but I sure can't think of any right now.

Apparently the producers felt the same way, and it seemed like the Riddick franchise was dead in the water for the better part of a decade, at least as far the silver screen was concerned (it supposedly had a favourable run of attached video games, a rare occurance in a world of low budget video game cash ins). 

But Vin Diesel was not so easily deterred. Becoming an action movie star in the time since *Pitch Black*, thanks in large part to *The Fast and the Furious* sequels now going into their seventh incarnation, Vin Diesel sunk his own money into producing another sequel.

In the third film (fourth if you count the *The Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury*, an animated direct to DVD sequel set between the events of *Pitch Black* and *Chronicles*), simply called *Riddick*, Vin Diesel reprises his role in what is by and large a remake of first film. Gone is the convoluted world building and supernatural plot lines. The back to basics Riddick vs the Elements film tries to exploit what made *Pitch Black* so good, and while it doesn't quite stick the landing, it was a good effort. 

But why? What is it that makes *Pitch Black* so good, *Chronicles* so bad and *Riddick* mediocre at best?


Part 1: Hero
============

`"They say most of your brain shuts down in cryosleep. All but the primitive side. The animal side. No wonder I am still awake"`

Richard B. Riddick
------------------

To truly understand the Riddick franchise, we need understand its narrative core, namely, Richard B. Riddick

In the first twenty four words of the film, *Pitch Black* tells you more about its protagonist than most films do in their entire three acts. These lines hook the audiences attention immediately. Who is this character that is somehow unaffected by Cryosleep, who refers to himself as a wholly "primitive animal"?

A confessed murder, Riddick is a total badass. Muscled, bald, supremely competent and arrogant, he is the very definition of an action movie hero.

The alpha male sensibilities that Riddick exudes provide a great deal of wish fulfilment for men. He is simultaneously feared and idolised. When he talks people listen, and when he says jump, people ask how high. The audience watches his every move, and his "bad guy with a heart of gold", persona makes him almost impossible to predict, and we are constantly guessing what he is going to do next.

Most traditional protagonists will move heaven and earth, usually by some deus ex machina, to protect those in their care (usually a female love interest). A typical example of this "white knight cliche" would be an antagonist capturing the love interest, at which point the hero will drop their weapons, and allow themselves to get captured to save them. Shortly after they will escape again and save the day. We have all seen it a million times.

Riddick is not one of these protagonists. He does what he can to save the other crew members, but he is pragmatic, never expecting a deus ex machina to help him save everyone in the face of impossible odds. This realism combined with his bleak outlook on life, and of course standard action movie trappings of witty one liners and a never say die attitude, makes him interesting.

And so we, like Jack in the movie, fall into a sort of hero worship of Riddick. And yet this hero worship is the very downfall of Riddick franchise, for the writers of the *Chronicles of Riddick* likewise fell in love with their character. And not unlike the internet's Chuck Norris Facts, his actions became grander with every retelling. 

But before we start to talk about *Chronicles*, let us have a analyse the character of Riddick in *Pitch Black*.

Alpha Male
----------

At the start of *Pitch Black*, Riddick is presented to us as the salient threat, the antagonist of a would be slasher film. Between his opening monologue and Johns doomsaying, we are given the impression that Riddick is a death dealing machine, that wouldn’t hesitate to “skullfuck you in your sleep”, in Johns most eloquent words.

In the wake of the crash, while the crew search for water, Riddick stalks in the shadows. While he never "ghosts" any of the crew members, the way he behaves implies that he is invulnerable, as though there is nothing that these mere mortals can do to harm him. 

He sneaks up behind Fry and secretly steals some of her hair and then later happily returns to the ship and starts drinking their booze, while they stand just meters away.

However, a short time later, the passengers find Riddick standing over the missing body of one of their murdered acquaintances. Presuming that Riddick has started his killing spree, they tackle him to the ground and after a brief skirmish, capture him.

So it is at this moment in the film, twenty seven minutes into the film, that Riddick utters his first line of on screen dialogue. And with his first words, his character changes completely.

I mentioned earlier that there are many similarities between *Pitch Black* and *Alien*. And indeed, there are. And if we are going to play with this analogy, then in this opening act, Riddick very much takes the role of the Xenomorph. 

Unquestionably dangerous, hiding in the shadows, attacking the crew members one by one while they hide in fear, Riddick is unquestioningly the Xenomorph of this first act. 

Yet at this point, the film suddenly turns into a more traditional survival movie. Riddick's role as "Big Bad", is suddenly taken out from under him, with the flock alien creatures that inhabit this planet becoming the crew's main threat.

And with the antagonist role taken, Riddick turns from the Jason or Freddy style killer to a sort of morally bankrupt guardian angel.

He quickly sets about devising a plan to get them all off the planet before the alien creatures rip them all to shreds. And, as though the aliens weren't bad enough, the group of survivors quickly start tearing themselves apart, with Riddick uncaringly pulling them along in his wake on his way to the escape ship.

But before we discuss the rest of the movie, let us have a look the twist in the movie where his character turned from antagonist to protagonist. 

Even in chains in his opening dialogue exchange with Fry, Riddick is clearly in control. Of course, he has somehow been captured, a grave error. But we have all been here before. The villain getting captured as part of his grand plan was a little less hackneyed in 2000, but has always been a classic trope of genre films, so we know that he will soon escape and start killing again.

And yet this twist never occurs. Getting captured never seems to have been part of Riddick's plan. Did he know that Johns would release him? Did he know that the only way that he would be able to get off the planet would be to travel with the rest of the passengers, allowing them to get picked off one by one, thus requiring him to get captured?

Indeed, it would not have been hard for to add a line of dialog for it to be so.

> `RIDDICK: “Come on Carolyn. You think I helped you out of the goodness of my heart?” LAUGHS Fry shakes her head, visibly upset.` 

> `RIDDICK: “I couldn’t make it all the way myself, I needed a distraction. That’s all you were to me Fry. Big, fat, juicy distractions” SMILES EVILY`

And yet, this never comes to pass. Riddicks role as antagonist truly does not outlive the first act. In fact, upon reflection, his actions of the first act are not conducive to an antagonist role when taken in context. Sure, he tried to incapacitate Johns in a bid to escape. But beyond that he doesn’t seem to bear any ill will to any of the crew members, even Johns.

His stalking of Fry seems to have been simply out of curiosity. He did not kill Zeke, which he was accused of. The film definitely tries to give you the sense of his danger in the first act, but upon a objective analysis, he never does.

We are informed by Johns that Riddick killed the pilot of his prison transport ship to escape. But we have no reason to believe that this is true. Johns, an already unreliable character, would have every reason in the world to lie about this to Fry.

Sure, Riddick admits to killing some people, but we have all seen *ConAir*, sometimes killing is justified, but the price must still be served.

But while Riddick may not be the villain of the piece, that is not to say that he is a saint. He tries to help the other passengers, but only to a degree. When one of the Imam’s boys gets cornered by one of the alien creatures, Riddick does not try to save him. He tells the boy to stay still, but when the boy runs, Riddick does nothing to intervene, clearly sensing the futility of trying to save boy.

This is not the behaviour of a normal protagonist. We need them to put their life on the line to protect the weak, we accept it as part of their hero's burden.

Yet despite the fact that Riddick often displaying cowardice and weakness, he still ends up being incredibly likeable. 

??? Tie these two paras together

It is because he performs acts that are unconscionable for a protagonist, that the audience finds him so interesting. He is able to make those choices that a hero cannot. 

Hypocrite
---------

However, there are times when, behind all the bravado and big words, the hypocritical side of Riddick can be seen.

For example, when Johns decides to sacrifice Jack to get the rest of the group to the ship, Riddick dispatches him. 

It is odd that Riddick so vehemently disagrees with Johns on this point. In a sense, as Johns explains, he *is* performing triage, letting one die so that the rest might live.

Yet shortly after this moral grandstanding, Riddick abandons all the survivors to escape by himself. Johns had told Riddick there was no way they could all get through, that they must sacrifice one of their number, and Riddick had clearly taken this as a unacceptable compromise.

But it is literally only a few minutes later that Riddick abandons them all to their fates and heads to safety. Perhaps he sees a difference between his decision and Johns.

One could conceive that their deaths were inevitable due to their own weakness, and that wasn't his problem, whereas Johns wanted him to kill an innocent girl to save his own life.

The question about the moral differences between causing a death by action and causing a death by inaction is one for a philosophy class, and I will not go into it here. Let's just say there are many viewpoints.

But as far as film logic goes, Riddick abandoning the survivors to their fate and Johns suggesting that they use one of the survivors for bait to save the others are equally reprehensible. 

And so this just ends up making Riddick seem like a hypocrite. So why is it that the audience forgives him for this? 

That is a difficult question to answer. And in reality, I think it largely due to the fact that we get distracted by the fact that the film switches to the character of Fry at that point in the film. The audience is too busy dealing with her story to truly analyse Riddick's behaviour in the context of his previous actions.

But even when analysing Riddick's actions objectively, it is difficult for us to criticise them. The fact is, we never quite lose the viewpoint of him being a villain. 

With all the things that he has done throughout the film, we never forget, that at the centre of everything, Riddick is a survivor. He has his own, perhaps selfish, code, that states that he will do whatever it takes to survive.

And the fact that he never apologises for that, provides him with the thinest of "moral codes", and the audience can't help but respect that. He tells Johns that he will come to regret not "ghosting", Riddick when he had the chance. And when Fry asks him to help him, he unapologetically states that `"You don't know anything about me. I will leave you here"`.

There is one thing that we can't stand, and that is betrayal. By being upfront and honest throughout about his villainy, we simply accept his actions. No matter how heinous a character might be, if they live by a code, we can forgive them. And so, in a sense, the survivors bring it on themselves. He warned them that he would betray them, and still they let him live and so Riddick is blameless for his actions.

The slipping mask
-----------------

So, Riddick is a villain, a ruthless killer, who cares only about his own survival. A stone cold badass, who leaves everyone in no doubt of his own selfishness.

Not quite. While a cursory glance of Riddick's character in may lead you to this conclusion, things are a lot more complicated than that.

For one thing, while Riddick tries at all times to play the part of a merciless convict, he isn't, at least not in *Pitch Black*. 

Throughout the film this mask slips, showing the weak, self doubting character beneath. While he tries not to let other see him in these moments of weaknesses, he doesn't always succeed, and the audience can tell.
 
He is prone to fits of anger. When Johns frees Riddick, he tells Riddick to `"remember this moment. The way it could have gone and didn't"`. Riddick is visibly annoyed, and lashes out. He snatches Johns' rifle from his hand, `"Fuck you!"`, he says threatening Johns, `"I want you to remember this moment"`.

Riddick should have kept his cool, graciously accepted Johns' phony treaty and waited his time, but instead he tries, unsuccesfully, to restore the balance of power in his favour, posturing that merely earns a grin from Johns.

He is clearly a troubled individual. He talks about his disdain for God, the long time he spent in prison and the fact that his mother supposedly abandoned him at birth, all pointing to a character who feels betrayed by life.

He harbours an emotional separation from the other characters, not empathising with them the way a normal protagonist would. 

Riddick shows variable loyalty the rest of the crew. He clearly fancies himself as a unapologetic badass, and tries to portray himself as such before the other characters. He delight's in their naiveté, and laughs at their collective misfortune.

His ire fall's most heavily on Abu, The Holy Man, with whom he has complicated relationship. Riddick sees his belief as a weakness. `"So where the hell's your God now?"`, he asks mockingly as the sudden rainfall starts to extinguish their last remaining torches.

But Riddick is not a sadist, nor without reason. He does try to get the entire crew to safety. He defends Jack against Johns, when Johns tries to betray her, and he continues to shepherd them to safety.

The scene in which Fry arrives at the ship just in time to prevent Riddick from leaving without them is the emotional climax of the film. It is where, we finally see not only what Riddick is made of, buy also Fry, who I will talk about more later.

The scene sees each of them having made it to safety against incredible odds, and the prospect of going back for the remaining survivors suddenly seeming like an impossible task.

> `RIDDICK: "Strong survival instinct. I admire that in a woman"`

> `FRY: "I promised them, that we would go back with more light"`

> `RIDDICK: "Did you? Hmmm"`

> `FRY: "What? Are you afraid?"`

> `RIDDICK: "Me afraid?" LAUGHING`

But Riddick is afraid. He doesn't think that he can do it. He already abandoned them once, when he decided to leave them at the last mile. Riddick is not a villian, he did not string his fellow passengers only to abandon them out of some kind of sadistic game. He truly believed he was too weak to save them, and his own survival instinct made him take the pragmatic approach.

When Fry tries to convince him to save the others, he simply counters with offering to take her with him, knowing it would be suicide, and that Fry is too clever to do otherwise.

> `RIDDICK: "You don't know anything about me. I will leave you here"`

> `FRY: "I can't. I can't" CRYING`

> `RIDDICK: "Sure you can, here I will make it easy on you`

> `Riddick stretches out his hand`

> `RIDDICK: "Take my hand, Come on, Come one"`

> `RIDDICK: "Look, no one is going to blame you Carolyn"`

> `RIDDICK: "Come on, Come on, That's it, That's it. Good Girl"`

In this scene, Riddick is trying to get Carolyn to also take the cowards way out. He clearly thinks that if she too, abandons the others, then he is no more guilty than her.

He asks her to come aboard, offering his hand, and coaxing her onboard with gentle words and nudges, to overcome her emotional paralysis. This scene is truly incredible, Fry finally breaking down, weeping in the rain as she slowly resolves to leave the other to their fate, while Riddick comforts her.

But at the last minute, Fry resolves to save others, even if it suicide.

> `FRY: "Now, you! You listen to me! I am the captain of this ship. And I am not leaving anyone on this rock"`

> `RIDDICK: "You would die for them?"`

> `FRY: "I would try for them"`

> `RIDDICK: "You didn't answer me"`

> `RIDDICK: "Yes I would Riddick, I would. I would die for them"`

> `Riddick takes off his goggles. A beat`

> `RIDDICK: "How interesting"`

It is in this moment that Riddick is most interesting. He has seen something that he can't explain. For Fry to selflessly go back for the others, even without Riddick's help, intrigues him.

But their journey is not yet over. They return and save the other crew members, but Riddick becomes separated from them, and is ambushed by two aliens. 

After their brief fight, Riddick is grievously hurt and alone, and Fry returns from the ship to save him.

> `FRY: "I said I would die for them. Not you"`

Fry helps Riddick back to his feet, but while helping him back to the ship, she dies herself.

It is difficult to know what the character of Riddick feels at this moment. 

At this point Riddick definitely sees a reflection of himself in Fry. The pragmatism, the cold exterior. And he can only take this as yet more evidence for his own belief that helping others only gets you killed.

And so while he may seem to blame himself, it is quite possible that he would let her take the blame for her own actions. He warned her of the dangers of such a selfless act, and she declared that she was willing to die for them.

He allows himself a moment to grieve, but once again, he tries to embody his persona of "stone cold killer", by the time that he once again joins the two remaining survivors. 

What his never-ending attempt to cling onto his mask says about his character, is as much a reflection of viewers feeling as Riddick's, but it is clear that he is not as unnaffected by her death as he tries to portray.

Killing Machine
---------------

In *Pitch Black* Riddick is frequently bested by the rest of crew. When he first escapes, John's is able to take him down, despite Riddick getting the drop on him (albeit, while shackled). And after he escapes, he is once again captured by crew, when they work together.

This kind of vulnerability is unusual for both a protagonist and antagonist alike. Heroes in genre films can usually take at least three direct hits from a grenade launcher before starting to bleed. To see a hero who is taken down with simply (???) swipes of a nightstick, is almost unheard of.

And not only is he physically weak, he does not have the usual prescience of a movie hero. He frequently misjudges both his enemies and his allies. When cornered by the creatures, he runs towards the rest of the crew, not predicting that they would instinctively shine light in his eyes. I have never seen such a trivial mistake made by a movie hero, and it imbues Riddick with a certain sense of believablity.

In addition, we can assume that John's was able to track down and capture Riddick by his skill as a bounty hunter. Johns does not seem particularly talented nor the "best tracker in the business".

We can therefore assume that while Riddick is obviously dangerous, as any escaped convict would be, there is no reason to believe that he is any more dangerous a prisoner than a bounty hunter would be expected to deal with on a daily basis.

In addition, Riddick tells us that he spent half his life in his previous "slam".  In fact, we are informed that he was only able to escape by hijacking a prison transport, we have no reason to believe that he is a man that no prison can hold. 

Cannon Fodder
-------------

Before we continue looking at Richard B. Riddick, let us take some time to consider the other characters in *Pitch Black*. 

Now, I have previously mentioned the similarities between *Alien* and *Pitch Black*. let us focus on that a bit closer. 

Both film's feature largely on female protagonists. Both movies involve getting stalked in the dark by aliens. Both movies feature largely civilian crew members. 

Consider:

In Alien, a [greedy crew member] brings a dangerous alien on board in an attempt to get rich. The Alien escapes, and then slowly hunts down each of the crew members in turn while the crew, headed by Ripley, try to track it down.

By contrast, in the first half of *Pitch Black*, John's brings a dangerous being on board in an attempt to get rich. Riddick escapes, and then (we are lead to believe) slowly hunts down each of the crew members in turn while the crew, led by Fry, try to track him down.

A forced analogy? Maybe. But as I have previously stated, in the first half of *Pitch Black*, before we truly understand the danger posed by the flying creatures, the audience is forced to see Riddick as the salient threat of the film.

Now, I have said that *Pitch Black* features a female protagonist. What, but I thought Riddick was the protagonist, I hear you say. Well yes, but let us take a minute and consider *Pitch Black* based on only the first 30 minutes.









The first act is unquestionably Carolyn Fry's movie. 

The film starts, with her waking up from cryosleep in the midst of a disaster. While her co-pilot Owens is still reeling from his sudden awakening, she is immediately into action, trying to land the ship.

She is then immediately confronted with an "action movie choice". With the ship crashing, she prepares to purge the passenger cabin. Owens talks her down, telling her that he has every confidence in her to be able to land the ship.

However, with ship still spinning out of control she attempts to purge the cabin anyway, but Owens has sabotaged the system, so that she is forced to try and land the ship intact.

It is at this point that we see the character Fry is, both in herself, and how she is reflected in Owens. She had the ability to land the ship, and Owens believes in her enough to entrust his own life into her hands. But she does not.

Is she merely being selfish, being willing to abandon people she doesn't know in a bid to save herself and her colleague? Perhaps, but she is also clearly pragmatic. In her mind, they are all going to die, and she is willing to make the sacrifices to save those she can. Hmm, now where have I heard this before?

This is often the kind of opening scene a movie would use to set up their main character. Perhaps this was a flashback, and she has since been rescued is now currently unable to forgive herself for trying to sacrifice all those people. One logical thing to do now, would be to cut to her waking up screaming in bed, before suddenly realising that she was just reliving her nightmare. Pan over to the futuristic alarm clock, showing that it is 3:34 in the morning, but never mind going back to sleep, Carolyn is going to wake up and brood. 

But fear not, soon an old friend calls her. They need a brilliant pilot. She says that she doesn't do that anymore. Ever since… "You can't blame yourself for that Carolyn, you did what you had to do." After a little bit of backstory, and perhaps a hint of past romance, she decides to at least listen to the offer. They get dinner in a shady diner with a shady backer, and after enough exposition, we are off on a good science fiction romp.

Instead, *Pitch Black* continues. Fry quickly assesses the damage, gathers to survivors and addresses the "Riddick problem". A lot of time is put into her emotion, and feelings at this point in the film. The guilt that she feels for Owens' death, not to mention trying to kill the rest of passengers.

She clearly doesn't have much motivation to do anything, but she still soldiers on, perhaps her military training kicking in. She organises the search for water and talks to Johns about the best way to deal with Riddick. She doesn't become overly demanding, or try and pull rank, and we genuinely like her.

In these ways she reminds me a lot of Ripley. Ripley is not the captain, nor is she a typical action hero. She is just someone who is trying to make their best of a bad situation.

Now, by this logic, opening narration aside, at the twenty seven minute mark, we could easily make the case that Fry is the protagonist of the film so far. And while Riddick takes over in the middle of the film, in a very real sense, it is Fry's arc that carries the most weight in the film.

In fact Riddick has so small a character arc that it is almost non-existent. By comparison, let us go back to climax that I mentioned earlier.

After Riddick's betrayal, Fry takes their last remaining light, and sprints into the night after him. Finally she confronts Riddick, and he tries to coax her onboard, to abandon the others and fly off with him.

Here, she is finally given her chance at redemption. Once again she has the option of either abandoning the others and saving her own life, or trusting in her own strength, and try to save them.

Throughout the movie, this has been the main tension of the film. The conversation that she has with Johns earlier in the movie, where she explains that Owens was trying to prevent her from killing the passengers, is overheard by Riddick.

Her decision weighs on her, killing her inside with every second she spends with those that she tried to sacrifice to save her own life. She is clearly conflicted with her own demons, and it manifests in the way that she tries to take charge and get everyone to safety, in an attempt to receive absolution.

Riddick asking her to once again abandon them hits her like a hammer. The tension growing, beat by beat, with Riddick's smiling evilly as he sees her break down. But then, she finally gathers her strength and throws it in his face, declaring that they are going back for the others, whether he likes it or not.

In fact, this reminds me a lot of the end of *Die Hard*. Midway through the film Sgt. Powell explains how after a shooting gone wrong he had never been able to draw his gun again and had been desk bound ever since.

Finally at the very end of the film, after the climax and celebrations have begun, he is finally able to shoot the one final terrorist. He is provided with an opportunity to put his mistake behind him, and reclaim his destiny.

Of course, by not living to the end of the movie, the sum total of the Fry storyline can only be so long. There is no way for her to be a part of any sequel, which is disappointing, because I think that her character would be very interesting to have seen in them.

She is a character that could have lead the entire movie, and perhaps even had her own franchise in a post *Alien* world, had the last five minutes gone a bit differently.

But, on the other hand, movies so seldom have the guts to deliver a truly devastating death, and I don't want to ever criticise one for doing so.

But Fry is not the only character of this piece. After the crash, the movie pauses long enough on the rest of the characters for us to get to like them. At this point in the movie, we are setting up for Friday 13th style slasher, and it is already clear that not everyone is going to make it off this planet.

But unlike most Friday 13th style movies, most of these characters are quite likeable and believable. Rather than thin stereotypes (The Scholar, The Athlete, The Whore, The Fool and The Virgin, as so eloquently stated in *Cabin in the Woods*), we get well rounded characters, each with their own motivations and abilities. 

This is in many ways, what makes *Pitch Black* such a good movie. You actually want all these characters to survive. Sure, you came to the movie to see the awesome kills, and you want your money's worth, but humanising these people only helps the film.

Abu, the Imam, is one of the most interesting of the secondary characters. In addition to being one of the few people to survive to the end, his paternal care of his acolytes brings a sense of a family to the film, without needing the inevitable "father's vengeance". 

He clearly cares a lot for his kids, but trusts in his God as they slowly and mercilessly get killed one by one. Perhaps he sees himself as a Job figure, seeking meaning in his punishment. Perhaps not.

But it is also this religious aspect that adds a good deal of depth to the film. The Imam finds himself in the company of atheists, who gently discount his faith (???, Is this true?). 

But discussions of God with Riddick are some of the more interesting parts of the films. Indeed, Riddick claims to believe in some kind of God figure, laying much of his own troubles at his feet. Whether this is a true belief or merely social construct that Riddick uses to explain the bad things that happen in this world, is known only to him however.

But the Imam's constant faith is something that Riddick starts to disdain. For a character like Riddick to go as far as to disdain something, speaks volumes about his thought on the topic. As we have seen so many times before, Riddick hides behind his mask.

He insults the Imam, but as with his conversations with Fry, I believe that this is probably to do with his envy. He wishes that he could have the Imam's faith, but when he finds that it is not inside him, he lashes out, as we have seen him to so many times before.






 When the rain starts to fall, Riddick asks `"So where the hell's your God now?"`. But shortly after, when Carolyn convinces Riddick to save them, the Imam finally says, `"There is my my God, Mr Riddick"`, to which Riddick simply smiles in acknowledgement.

Yes, that sentence can be interpreted two ways, but I think it can simply be taken as the Imam trying to say that God has a plan for Riddick.

As they finally fly into the sunset, the Imam acknowledges, that `"There is so much prayer to make up for, I scarcely know where to begin"`, Jack replies, `"I know where I would start"`.

I never did really understand what Jack meant in this scene. The best I can guess is that she meant that she would thank God for Riddick, but if anyone has a better idea I would love to hear it.







This brings up the character of Jack. A young girl travelling alone, masquerading as a boy, she has apparently run away and is wandering through the galaxy.

Jack falls for Riddick's mystique almost immediately, quickly fashioning replicas of Riddick's trademark goggles, and running around the ship terrorising the rest of the crew, in the way on children can, until one passenger finally quips, `"Did you run away from your parents or did they run away from you?"`

Jack is very believable and never annoying as young characters in these movies so often are. 

In the scene where Riddick and Fry are talking about Zeke's disappearance, Jack enters and starts asking about Riddick's eyes. This is a wonderful bit of exposition, and a chance for Jack to show her fascination with Riddick, and the secret of his surgical shine job which is so poorly executed on in the sequel.

Jack's gender is a secret kept from both the characters and the audience well into the film. When the crew must pass the most dangerous point in their journey Riddick halts the group, stating that it will be impossible to go any further, `"Especially with the girl bleeding."`

I actually like this scene quite a lot. There is quite a subtle body language between Jack and Fry which reminds me of the maternal relationship between Ripley and Newt in *Aliens*. It isn't focused on, but as the two remaining female survivors, something flashes between them, and just the way that Fry stands, it seems as though she is trying to protect Jack.

Jack also has a crucial role to play moments later, when Johns asks Riddick to "triage" Jack to save the rest of the group. Why precisely Johns would make this request isn't exactly clear. 

Perhaps he too has fallen for the tough guy disguise that Riddick is harbouring, but he clearly misjudges Riddick. Riddick quite clearly states that there is a line that he won't cross and Johns flew way over it.

Without any real warning, Riddick dispatching Johns and returns to the group, informing them that Johns is dead, although not why. When Jack starts to get upset about losing him, Riddick simply says, `"Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare"`.

But even the other characters, while minor roles, are still very likeable. None of them really conform to typical stereotype roles, and they all have a little bit to contribute to the film. While inevitable, you do feel a little sorry for each of them as they are dispatched, albeit normally at their own hands for not doing as they are told.

Part 2: Villain
===============

And so, here we are, at the end of film. Riddick, Jack and Abu all fly into the sunset, to their next adventure (technically, *The Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury*, but, while I do like this movie quite a bit, the fact that it is only 30 minutes long and animated, means I will not consider it canonical for this analysis)

*Pitch Black*, in my opinion at least, is a great film. What could have succeeded solely as a entertaining horror movie, simply on the cool sci-fi setting, monsters, and kills, is exalted by Fry's solid character arc and Riddick's enigmatic self.

But where do you go from here?

If *Pitch Black* has a lot in touch with *Alien*, when sure we should look to *Aliens* to find inspiration. *Aliens* starts with Ellen Ripley completing her 57 year journey back to earth, and upon arrival no one believes her story about Xenomporph. 

But when an accident appears to have occurred on LV-426, she  is requested to travel back, as her insight will be vital to defeating the alien menace. When she arrives, she is greeted with more Aliens, and an excellent subplot involving Newt.

*Aliens* puts aside its Sci-fi Horror roots, and takes on a more Sci-fi Action role, which does the movie credit. The plot is bigger, and a few hints are thrown in. The previously mentioned "Company", is revealed to be Yutani Weyland, and their conspiracy subplot adds a good deal of interest to the movie, including a real antagonist for the protagonist to fight against.

There are many reasons why *Aliens* succeeds as a movie. Sadly none of them can be found  in *Pitch Black*'s sequel, *The Chronicles of Riddick*.

<!--- There are so many problems with *Chronicles* that is difficult to know where to begin. And while, I will spend some time enumerating these mistakes, they are largely irrelevant, in the wake of the films biggest flaw: The complete destruction of the character of Riddick. --->

The Rude Goldberg Machine
-------------------------

*The Chronicles of Riddick* is complicated. Too complicated. Following on from a simple sci-fi horror movie, there was really not much that the audience required, beyond Riddick kicking more ass. 

After the events of *Pitch Black*, in which we simply get to see one small planet in the middle of nowhere, *Chronicles* wanted to build a world for Riddick to live in. What that resulted in is a tangle of knots, strangling everything that was good about the first film.

But before we get into the details, let us compare and contrast the first forty minutes of each film.

In *Pitch Black*, a spaceship crashes on a planet. A dangerous criminal Riddick escapes. The survivors search for water, before recapturing Riddick. They suspect Riddick of killing one of the passengers, but discover a race of aliens is responsible, at which point they ask Riddick to help protect them.

In *Chronicles*, an army of religious zealots are found to be marauding through space killing all in their path. Riddick is shown to be hiding on a ice planet. A group of mercenaries are out to catch him, but he dispatches them. They tell him that the Imam sent them to capture him. He takes their ship and goes to get revenge on the Imam for betraying him. Once he meets the Imam, he is told that he wasn't betrayed, but that they need him to save the universe from the Necromongers, due to a prophesy. But before he can decide whether to help them or not, he is attacked by the local militia. After dispatching them, they are suddenly attacked by the Necromongers, whom he also dispatches. Riddick tries to save the Imam and his family, but sadly the Imam dies. Riddick then seeks out the person who killed the Imam. But after getting his revenge, he is captured by the Necromongers and taken in front of the prophetic "Quasideads", who instruct the Necromongers to kill him. But Riddick soon escapes the clutches of the Necromongers, only to be recaptured by the mercenaries from the beginning of the film. Riddick quickly tricks them into sending him to Crematoria, the prison in which Jack has been detained, in an attempt to free her.

If your head is already spinning, try watching the film. It is really a shame that so many mind boggling plot points are thrown-in in such an ad-hoc fashion, because the first twenty minutes was pretty tight. But the film soon looses steam, and with barrage after barrage of twists and reveals, the film soon looses all focus, and the audience is left with no idea what is meant to be going on.

In *Pitch Black*, there is a constant reminder of what the characters goal is: Stay in the light, get to the skiff, escape the planet. These goals are repeated over and over in the film, keeping the audience focused.

In *Aliens*, the plot is as simple as investigate the base, try and escape. Everything else is a detail, and you never forget what the characters objectives are.

But the goals of Riddick, not to mention the rest of the cast, seem to change on a scene by scene basis. He may be flying full pelt in one direction before turning on the spot to head with equal urgency in the opposite. And yet when he finally arrives there, he is inexplicably back where he started.

<!--- ??? Riddick starts with his motivation being to stay hidden, hence his self banishment on the ice planet. Then he wants to punish the Imam for ratting  him out. Then he wants to escape the planet which is being invaded. Then he wants to get revenge for the Imams death. Then he wants to save Jack. And then he wants to become Emperor of the Universe. Make up your mind already!

And none of these changes seem to really have any weight to them. They literally come out of nowhere, with no explanation. And the audience can't help but be confused, swept up in a torrent of bad dialog and special effects.

And in some movies, this is fine. If this were a political thriller, or a murder mystery, it would be totally normal to expect the audience to keep multiple distinct plots and motives in order. But *Chronicles* is not this kind of movie. --->

I'm surrounded by Assholes
--------------------------

This completely bewildering lack of focus is not helped by the supporting characters, every single one of whom, with the small exception of the Imam, are completely unlikable.

As I have previously stated, one of *Pitch Black*'s strongest features is that the entire roster of characters are all interesting, or at the very least very likeable, right down to the would be  antagonist role of Johns.

*Chronicles* is so completely void of such characters that it is almost impressive. Nowhere is this more clear that with the character of Toombs, the   bounty hunter taking the roll of a would-be Johns.

But while Johns is cool and collected and an altogether human character, Toombs is quite the opposite. Despite its science fiction setting, *Pitch Black* feels real and believable, and Johns fits perfectly in this universe. He is not loud or obnoxious. He is a serious man, who just wants to do his job and get paid.

By contrast Toombs is a giant cartoon character, an almost mustache twirling villain. No doubt the script must have said something along the lines of "Kid Catcher from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang", in the character notes.

He is totally unhinged, has no empathy for anyone else in the film, and spouts such terrible one liners, it is a miracle that anyone can stand him for more than about twenty seconds.

Toombs would have been so out of place in *Pitch Black*, he would have burst straight through the fourth wall, so over top is his character, and yet somehow he fits into the world of *Chronicles*.

And this is because he is just one specific example of a problem that is endemic in the entire film. The characters throughout the film are so unlikable, I almost cannot believe that these two films were written by the same author. Where was the subtlty, the quietness that made *Pitch Black* what it was?

And this continues throughout all the facets of the films supporting cast. Not one character, besides the Imam, is anything less than a horrible two dimensional stereotype. The prison guards and prisoners in Crematoria, are so completely unlikable, not to mention entirely illogical. 

Indeed, it seems as though Abu is the only character to have escaped unscathed in this sequel, but I can't help but wonder if an early draft of the script had him as some kind of "action-preacher", fighting off bad guys side by side with Riddick, until the actor refused to do so, whether out of physical inability or a modicum of self respect.

My eyes!
--------

I don't want to spend too much time on the visual problems in *Chronicles*. In retrospect, they are largely irrelevant.

But I would like to point out, that for the last twenty years, it seems like every single time that a director who works wonders on a shoestring budget with practical effects and sets, get a big budget for a sequel, they spend it on terrible looking CG.

And the CG isn't even the worst parts of the film. Many of the action scenes are terribly edited. The scene with Riddick against the militia or against the Necromongers the city, is filmed in almost complete darkness, with just enough muzzle flash to make sure it is completely impossible to follow what is going on. 

I am sure that the Director was trying to make some kind of homage to *Equilibrium*, but it doesn't work in *Chronicles* in every way that it does work in *Equilibrium*.

There are more action scenes in the first twenty minutes of *Chronicles* than in the whole of *Pitch Black*, and they are terrible! Where before the director used his budget sparingly, focusing on executing just a few scenes well, once given sufficient budget, he daubed great swaths of mediocrity all over the place.

Of course, it does make you wonder whether the director was actually any good to begin with. Hollywood is filled with accidental success stories, of how low budgets and bad props made films exceed their expectations. *Jaws* is obviously one of the most famous, but *Cat People (1942)* is another famous example of props being so terrible, and the lack of budget preventing better ones, that director was forced to be creative, and focus on the negative space, generating suspense. 

Had the director had their way, and nothing had gone wrong, would the films have been such a success? We will never know.

But in light of *Chronicles*, one is forced to analyse whether perhaps *Pitch Black* was just a happy accident, whether all that great subtlety and suspense, was simply because the director did not have enough rope to hang himself. For me, whether the film succeeded or failed on purpose or by accident is largely irrelevant, and I won't dwell on it, but to me it seems clear that the Twohy fell, like so many other directors, for the budget trap, and it is hard to blame him for it.

Attack of the Body Snatchers
----------------------------

But, above all this, above any editing or special effects, above the unlikable supporting cast or bewildering plot, the one unforgivable downfall, was the destruction of the character of Richard B. Riddick.

Throughout the whole of *Pitch Black* Riddick is simply an ex-con trying to escape the planet with his life, nothing more.

By the end of *Chronicles*, he is the prophesied Space Jesus, and the leader of an army of religious zealots hell bent on the destruction of the universe.

But before we go there, let's start to with the basics.

The character of Riddick in *Pitch Black* is a simple human. He is strong and resourceful, a good guy to have on your side in a tight spot. But he is human nonetheless. 

As I have already pointed out before, both Johns and the crew are both roughly equal to Riddick, in terms of athletic power when push comes to shove. While he is rightly respected for his prowess in the darkness, when the crew catch him in the daylight they are able to overpower him in a one on one battle. He is not Superman.

And yet, in a film that takes place less than ten years later, he has somehow turned into a cross between Jason Bourne, Rambo and Conan.

The film starts on pretty solid ground, with Riddick's opening fight with the bounty hunters on an ice planet, which remains firmly within the bounds of reality.

Riddick is outnumbered and outgunned. So what does he do? He goes to familiar ground, to the darkness, where he has the advantage and the mercenaries make easy pickings. Once safely in his cave where their vision and movement is hampered, Riddick takes them out one by one, "ghosting" them off camera. Finally, once all the henchmen are taken care of, Riddick takes Toombs on, mano-a-mano, to find out who sent him.

This is actually a great scene. It is shot well, and the way that the camera is looking everywhere that Riddick is not, reminds the audience of how effective a stealth killer Riddick is.

Here we see the Riddick that know and love from *Pitch Black*. He is smart and calculating, using his quarries arrogance against them, before taking them down with a glee that the audience can't help but revel in it. We sit up in our seats waiting for more.

But the problems soon start when Riddick takes on the local militia on Helion Prime. Firstly, the militia's motivation is never fully explained. They just kind of show up, accuse Riddick of being a spy, and start shooting the place up. And once they are dispatched, nothing more comes of it.

The only reason for this scene that I can think is that the writer thought that there had been too much exposition in the last five minutes (tell me about it) and that the audience must be getting bored.

??? - Image of Judi Dench talking, sub: Wow, I have been talking a lot, when is the next action scene?

As I have already mentioned, the fight scene is shockingly filmed and edited, but that isn't even really the problem. The character of Riddick himself is also shockingly distorted. The Riddick from *Pitch Black* has never shown himself to be someone who would take on twenty armed men, with no real fear of getting hurt.

Sure, he starts by extinguishing the candles, once more reemphasising that he works best in the shadows, but I can't help but think that Riddick would have simply dived out of the window against such overwhelming odds.

No one ever knows where a bullet is going to go, and while it is totally conceivable for other movie heroes to take on twenty men at once, it seems somewhat out of place for Riddick.

Sadly, this is a theme that would continue for the entire film. Riddick is suddenly entirely fearless.

Riddick continues to take on legion upon legion of bad guys, from scores of Necromongers to the convicts of Crematoria. There are is even a boss fight at the end, which in all fairness, is a near universal trope of the genre, but feels so awkward by its conspicuous absence in *Pitch Black*.

In every one of these fights, Riddick never seems to show the slightest bit of fear, or restraint. He charges in, all guns boazing, assured of success, because, hey, its the middle of the movie, he can't die yet right?

And this is such a shame. *Pitch Black* set up such a unique hero, who has to make use of his brains to make up for his lack of brawn, and they carelessly discard this in favour of bigger action scenes.

And while Riddick's brawn had been clearly put into overdrive, his brains have likewise been lobotomised. In *Pitch Black* Riddick was always a thinker. He had a slow, pensive attitude to things, contemplating all the possible actions, weighing one against the other, before making his decisions. 

Nothing ever felt rushed or sudden with Riddick. He didn't suddenly decide to do things on a whim, every action was calculated to the final detail.

In *Chronicles*, this character is no where to be seen. Riddick's decisions seem to have not the least bit of thought put into them. As previously stated, his motivations seem to swing on a dime, and his actions with them.

Riddick has previously been shown to not be especially prescient, not capable of seeing ten or even three moves ahead of everyone else. Yet, he is suddenly performing actions that would have every single time resulted in his death, had he not been incredibly lucky. 

When he went to get revenge for the Imams death, was he committing suicide? Surely he knew that he wouldn't just be allowed to kill a ranking member of the occupying force and be allowed to leave?

He would definitely have been killed, and he would have known this. Perhaps he no longer cared, but this just doesn't fit with Riddick's main character attribute: Survival Instinct.

Riddick would definitely not sacrifice his life to kill a soldier, who was, in a sense, simply doing his job. There are certainly characters who it is believable would do so, the father in *Taken* for example, but Riddick absolutely would not.

And not only because he has a remarkable penchant for self preservation, but he had just recently been told that Jack was incarcerated in Crematoria. Earlier he seemed, albeit somewhat inexplicably, as though he blamed himself for her imprisonment, surely he would need to settle that score.

Or what about the Imam's family, that he was just a few hours ago trying to save. Would he just abandon them to their fates, rather than taking them off planet like he promised the Abu he would?

And while we never see the holy man's family again, when he is captured by the mercenaries again just a short time later, he tricks them into taking him to Crematoria. Was this part of his plan all along? Did he really feel bad about Jack, and want to save her? In that case, why had he just put himself in a position where he would almost certainly be killed? He clearly could not have expected to survive his encounter with the Necromongers, and he had no clear plan of getting to Crematoria either.

The escape from the Necromongers itself is laughable. The number of ridiculous mistakes that happen at every turn to allow him to escape is comical, not to mention incomplete. The film is quite happy for Riddick to be stuck in the inner sanctum of their space castle one minute, inexplicably outside in the very next scene, being chased by a massive cg spaceship to boot.

As though things weren't implausible enough already, this warship is suddenly brought down by our bounty hunter friends, who with the aid of a small rocket launcher are able to take the spaceship down. Is there any point even complaining at this point? It genuinely feels as though no one even cares anymore; why should I?

Nevertheless, at this point, despite taking down these bounty-hunters already, a militia, scores of Necromongers, a Necromonger lieutenant, more necromancer soldiers and escaping their melodramatically protected castle, Riddick is suddenly captured by these bounty-hunters.

Even trying to interpret Toombs' motivation at this point hurts my head. The Imam and the Elemental have clearly dropped the bounty of Riddick's head, so there is no reason for them to capture Riddick anymore.

And the risk reward ratio can only have gotten worse, with Toombs increased knowledge of how dangerous Riddick is, and the fact that he is stuck on an occupied planet, and the bounty offered by Crematoria must be much lower than before.

Yet, Riddick seems to have no problem with any of this. He quite happily hands himself over to be captured, and tricks the mercenaries into being transported to Crematoria.

Now we come to trying to decipher Riddick's completely bewildering actions. Did he know Toombs was coming for him? Did he know that Toombs wouldn't just shoot him on-site? Did he know that he would be able to get Toombs to take him to Crematoria? 

Did he in fact even have breaking Jack out of Crematoria on his todo list at all before that very moment in time, because none of his previous actions seem to even hint towards this possibility. This seems to be yet another one of the complete one-eighty that the film pulls.

And we come once again to the complete lack of focus that the film has. But, if it were just the film that had no focus, it would be almost forgivable. If it decided to randomly start to focus on random characters or get into obscure backstory, there would be only so much that I could complain about.

But the fact is that Riddick himself is unfocused, and it feels like a complete betrayal of his character.

Out of his depth
----------------

But the supercharging of Riddick's character isn't completely illogical. The fact is, it needed to occur for him to be able to fit into the universe that *Chronicles* has suddenly created.

The story is suddenly just too big for Riddick to handle. Getting survivors to their escape ship is within Riddicks power, and makes for an interesting story. To single handedly defeat an entire invading army that have left countless destroyed planets in their wake, seems a little out of his wheelhouse.

When Riddick landed on Helion Prime, he reminds the Imam, and the audience, what his speciality is:

`I am sure God has his tricks. But getting out of places that nobody else can, that's one of mine`.

This is actually a great line. It reminds of their religious animosity towards each other, while cementing what Riddick's super power is: Survival instinct.

And yet, Riddick is suddenly required to literally solve the entire universe's problems. Why could we not simply have had the story be that he needed to save Jack?

In fact, the first ten to twenty minutes would remain almost entirely unchanged, apart from removing the prologue about the Necromongers.

We could once again have Riddick being tracked by the Bounty Hunters, but when he arrives on Hellion Prime, Abu explains that Jack has finally got herself in more trouble than she can handle.

After their escape, Abu had adopted her as a sort of surrogate daughter, a prodigal daughter at that. She was never able to accept his way of life, but there was something that they admired in each other, something that had always kept them together.

But as Jack reached her adolescence, she started to rebel, the birth of the Imam's daughter not helping their relationship. At first the Imam treated it with light humour. But as she fell deeper and deeper into the criminal underworld, he started doing everything he could to return her to the straight and narrow path.

Finally, one night he was forced to bail her out of jail. They had a falling out that night, and after an argument, she walked out of his life.

But the Imam has just got the news that she finally bit off more than she can chew, and is now incarcerated in Crematoria. He has done everything that he can do, talked to every one of his friends in government, even tried to bribe some of them. His faith has truly been tested.

But after everything has failed, he had no choice but to send for Riddick. And here we are, the start of a great Ocean's Eleven style caper. Break into Crematoria, find Jack, Break her out, with plenty of fights and explosions on the way.

In fact, I suspect even I could write a screenplay based on this premise, that would be better than the one *Chronicles* had to offer.

This is absolutely the kind of task that Riddick has it within his power to solve. Remaining undetected, working in dark dangerous corners of the universe, and escaping with his life, and bringing those less fortunate with him to safety.

And it could have so easily come to pass. The fact is, once you remove the Necromonger subplot, the rest of the film isn't too bad. An edit of *Chonciles* that was an hour and a half long, in which only the bounty hunter and crematoria scenes were left, would have been perfectly reasonable.

The Curate's Egg
----------------

ANd on that note, while the film is indeed a disaster, there are undoubtedly some good parts, however fleeting they may be.

The one small emotional glimmer in the film, is the precious few scenes that Riddick and Jack, now called Kyra, spend together.

Indeed, I do wonder what precisely the filmmakers decision behind her name change was. There is obviously some attempt at a certain repetition. Riddick always pronounces her name *Cara*, with an obvious attempt to remind you of the protagonist of the former film.

And in the same way as Carolyn Fry previously, Kyra sacrifices her life to save Riddick.

It seems really unecessary to have changed her name in the film, if there attempt was truly to drive this home; we get it, it doesn't pay to be Riddick's friend.

But there are other scenes in which we can almost glimpse something a little deeper within them. Their scene in Crematoria in which Riddick confronts Jack about her decision to sign up with mercenaries, actually feels like a small pocket of depth under an otherwise shallow surface.

The abandonment that Jack feels, almost seems to resonate with Riddick. He obviously explains that he was doing it for own good, but then again, don't negligent fathers always?

Of course, having seen him living on a ice planet at the beginning of the film, we can only assume that he was doing this for her own good, but you can genuinely understand Kyra's frustration with Riddick.

It is such a shame that this isn't the entire core of the film. The very scenes that the two of them share together fleet with almost being good, heady heights compared to their surrounding.

Although, in actual fact, large amounts of the Crematoria scenes are good. The shootout is well shot, and the generally what is going on is quite interesting. Even the somewhat mediocre chase scene, in which *Pitch Black*'s premise is flipped on it's head, and they are required to stay *out* of the light on their way to ship, is relatively interesting.

It is not until the Necromongers show up, and Riddick suddenly gets a deus-ex-machina in the form of a magical power-up that we suddenly reminded of the ridiculousness of the plot.

Dead End
--------

But we are now reaching the end of the film, and after a dull and boring final boss battle, Riddick takes over the necromonger army.

Where does he go from here? 












There is a nice little line that Riddick uses here, where he talks about who there is no such thing as a friend, and that he should never have trusted the Imam. 

It is subsequentally revealed that Riddicks story to Abu about how he started out `in some trash bin with an umbilical cord wrapped around his neck`, wasn't simply the fact that he was an unwanted child, but actually the fact that one of the Necromongers trying to strangle him with own umbilical cord, during their invasion of Furya to try and prevent the prophecy.

What The Fuck? 

This is one of the weirdest decisions I think in movie making history. To go from such a simple story, about a group of survivors, straight into a giant space opera, is just weird.

In addition, our previously simple character, who already had plenty of interesting backstory, (who did he kill and why, how do his eyes really work, what was that "shine job" all about?), and convert him into an alien and Space Jesus simultaneously. 





This is such a weird thing for Riddick's character to do. He never showed more than a passing affection for Jack, a loose friendship, but nothing like the connection he had with Fry.

It seems odd that Riddick, who wants people to succeed and fail by their own strength, would suddenly feel that Jack needs to be rescued.

Perhaps he blames himself for what has happened to her. After all, she was instantaneously infatuated with Riddick, and when she asked about the surgical shine job, Riddick told her just enough to get her in trouble.

But the very fact that this character has supposedly killed people to be sent to prison, so that she can get this surgery done is completely bonkers. Seriously, there is no market  on the outside to get this performed?

Surely, just about anything is easier than getting convicted of a crime, sneaking your payment into the prison, bribing the surgeon to perform the surgery and then break out of the prison again.

Yet this is what the movie wants us to believe that this character has done. I mean, how can Riddick not admonish her for being incredibly stupid?













At first, he was hiding on a ice planet, for a reason that is never fully explained other that to say "??? You should all stay away from me", to him travelling to the Imam to kill him for betraying him, to trying to escape the invasion, to trying to extract revenge for the Imams death, to trying to save Jack, to trying to assassinate the Lord Marhsall of the Necromancers to take their place.


























Part 3: Survivor
================

Perhaps it is fitting that the franchise, like its protagonist, seems to have some kind of incredible survival instinct.

After panning of *The Chronicles of Riddick* by critics, fans and general audiences alike, it seemed as though Riddick was headed to the graveyard of failed franchises. 

It's baggage was unwieldy and direction unclear. And while this would have been fine had the film made money, the box office receipts were unimpressive, and it seemed as though Riddick would not be returning to the silver screen.


Solution

A discussion about how a sequel to a movie like *Pitch Black* can best be executed. Can it?




How then, do you create a sequel to a movie like *Pitch Black*? Well it seems that Vin Diesel seems to think that you do it by remaking it within it's own continuity. And is he wrong?

Not really. Riddick is a good film, all things considered. It quickly jettison's the extraneous Necromonger plot lines alla Alien 3, and adds a family member bent on revenge for his family member that Riddick killed in the first film, alla Die Hard with a Vengeance.

The film is heavy handed in its use of repetition, both of plot points and shots. In many ways it is these scenes that are the best in the movie.

What about the "superhero effect"? Yes, it is there. The Riddicck in *Riddick* is significantly more powerful than his counterpart in *Pitch Black*. But it is not quite to the same degree that *Chronicles* go to. 

This Riddick can be hurt. He makes mistakes. He gets captured. And in the final "climax" of the film, he even needs too be saved by his enemies.

There are many problems with the *Riddick*. For starters, the film really needs to have it's dialog almost completely rewritten from scratch.

In addition, none of the character's motivations make any sense. Every single one of the bounty hunters is supposedly here to kill Riddick, and yet they never do it, despite the many opportunities that they have.

The addition of the "cells" plotline goes a long way to fixing this issue. Obviously they cannot kill him once he has hidden the cells somewhere in the desert, but why does Johns save him at the end? He only moments before abandoned Riddick to take both power cells back to the ship, and yet something in the last half and hour or so has made him change his mind so that he now needs to save Riddick?



Why does thug number 1 suddenly attack Johns when Riddick is digging? Surely you would kill Riddick first, and why would you even try and kill Riddick? Every single person in the film who has crossed him so far has died! Leave him alone.




Also, unlike *Pitch Black*, nearly every single one of the characters is completely unlikable. One of *Pitch Black*'s strong points was the fact that most of the characters were actually quite likeable. None of the characters were over the top cliches. Even Johns, as flawed as he is, acted more like a scared chid than a action villain stereotype.

You genuinely want all the characters in *Pitch Black* to make it through. The same can not be said of *Riddick*. Every single one of the characters is completely unlikable.

You have absolutely no empathy for any of the characters that die, and no joy for those who live. In *Pitch Black*, when Jack and Abu escape the planet with Riddick, you feel genuinely relieved for them, and feel a very real sense of pain that Fry didn't make it.

You do not feel the least thing for these characters. They have all backstabbed and bitched and postured the whole movie, and you can't help but think the movie would be better without them.

In fact, have there ever been non-protagonist bounty hunters or mercenaries that the audience has ever empathised with? There is a whole sub population of society that the film industry has completely marginalised as evil greedy cannon fodder. I have known a few mercenaries in my time, and they have been lovely people, no worse than any national military solider. But while soldiers get to get shot holding a picture of their girlfriends while Adagio for Strings plays, mercenaries get gunned down with gleeful abandon, without ever a thought that perhaps this person was only on this job in an attempt to put food on table for their family.

Nevertheless, it is not the job of "Riddick" to try and reverse this trend. Simply be aware of it, and realise that the audience is not going to sympathise with mercenaries the way it is going to empathise with the survivors of the Hunter Gratzner.

And on the subject of empathising, a dog, seriously? Don't get me wrong, the dog was one of the better parts of the film. Firstly the, CG on it was excellent, about as good as I have seen. That said, it never stops being a CG dog. Vin Diesel is just able to act as though there is a real dog there. There is something about the way that people's eyes move when they are looking at a creature, that is completely lost, and just makes me feel like I am sitting on a sterile set whenever he and the dog are sharing a scene.

But anyone who has been around the film block for a while, could have told you that the dog was not long for this world. "Evil people kill dogs", is one of the biggest tropes in Hollywood, and it seems as though the film wants to villainise Santana much more for the killing of a dog who was attack him, than for the rape and murder of a woman at the beginning of the second act.


"Ball's deep"? What the fuck? Since when does a hero threaten a woman with rape? Okay, technically, all he implied was that he would have sex with her, not that it would it would be non-consensual. But the character was pre-established to be homosexual (which I will come back to later). To imply that Riddick's action's over the next twenty four hours would be such that she would change her sexual orientation, is simply adolescent male (read: Vin Diesel) wish fulfilment.

And why does her character even need to be a lesbian? It seems to me to be a real shame that it seems like no woman can possibly be tough in movies or television, without being a lesbian. This is not really the forum for this discussion, but seriously..

On the subject of homosexuality, I think it would have been much more interesting if it had turned out that John's had been John's husband rather than father.

Indeed, I though that the film was setting up for this. John's never implies that he is the father, Riddick induces it, and Johns never confirms nor denies it. Then later in the film, Riddick inform's Johns that his son was a junkie to which Johns Sr replies, "That is no the man I knew". Do father's refer to their son's as "the man I knew". Sure. But they are much more likely to say something like, "He was a good kid". This would have been a perfect juncture to reveal that Johns Sr was actually Johns husband.

The shock that your husband was a drug addict and you never knew about it, is so much more visceral than that your son is a drug addict. There are ten thousand movies about men's son's doing drugs and their father saying "you are going to ruin your life if you go down this path son".

But there are precious few films about how discovering that your partner is a drug addict can destroy your life. This would have been a far more interesting story. Firstly, it personalises the original Johns much more. You never think about the fact that he has a family or loved ones. It never occurs to you that he might be so viciously hunting Riddick's bounty because he has a husband to provide for

And I think that discovering that your Husband is was a drug addict is just so much more potent. Johns would have had to completely rethink their relationship. All those little things would suddenly start to make sense, as they always do. Ultimately it would make no difference, he would love him just as much.

finally, it would mean that the actor wouldn't look way to young to be Johns father. Ten years have passed since the events of *Pitch Black*. Taking that into account, Both Johns are about the same age, so I can only suppose that Johns Sr has had some serious work done. Perhaps he exchanged twenty menthol kools for a surgical face lift.

Not only that, but he is beaten to the point of near unconciousness by a mere two creatures, who have already shown themselves to not be particularly dangerous, relatively speaking. He needs Fry to save him after his battle, and is so weak, that he is not even capable of saving her.

By contrast, the Riddick presented to us in *Chronicles*, is an unstoppable killing machine, who is able to take down crew after crew of highly skilled mercenaries unarmed, dangerous convicts with nothing more tin cup and necromancer Gods with a simple dagger.

He infiltrates Crematoria without any apparent doubt that not only he, but also Jack, will be able to subsequently break out.


This is sadly one of the common mistakes that all sequels seem to be prone to. Once your hero has defeated one enemy, they need to be given a bigger test. This is why a New York City cop who's initial actions are initially to call the police, is only three movies later blowing up a helicopter with a car and surfing a jet.

It seems impossible for films to let a character be anything less than a superhero by the time their second movie comes around. Even Alien is not completely immune to this, with with the Ripley from Aliens being significantly more badass than her previous incarnation.

That is not to say that the Riddick presented in *Pitch Black* is weak. He shows himself to be supremely competent, but he never quite stops being human. 





So it is not clear quite how dangerous Riddick is. In fact it is Johns who posses a far more salient threat to the survivors. 

Johns is selfish, with a morphine addiction to boot.  He was more than willing to kill Jack to save his own life, and he is fixing to betray Riddick from the moment that he frees him.




Who is the protagonist of this version?












Perhaps, all we need for someone to be a protagonist is for the audience to identify with them, to see the world from their point of view. Indeed, there are plenty of stories out there about anti-heroes, who we identify with and are undoubtedly the protagonists of their own films.

But can Riddick, who does not utter a single line of dialog for the first twenty seven minutes of the film, possibly be considered the film's protagonist? Is he the character that the audience most sympathise with?










It would not have been hard, for a writer to pick up the film after forty five minutes and turn it into a standard Freddy or Jason style slasher, with perhaps just one of the crew members escaping with the escape ship (with a cut of Riddick hiding in the engine bay for the stinger).









But this is not the direction the film chooses to take. It instead becomes much more interesting. Johns makes a deal with Riddick: help them, guide them, and he will get his freedom.

But before we discuss the rest of the film, let us look where we are after twenty seven minutes.





Indeed, despite the science fiction setting, flesh eating monsters and so forth, the action in Riddick actually is far more believable than almost any movie.

"It looks clear"





But then Fry's personal journey finally resolves. She determines that she would rather face death, even certain death, than leave any of her crew to die. She is able to rectify her mistake, to forgive herself for trying to purge the passenger hold



The first film, *Pitch Black*, is a film about survival, about many characters working together to survive the elements. In many ways, Riddick is just just one of those characters.

a character who never became much more than human. 

It is often difficult to consider *Pitch Black* as it's own film, so intertwined is the Riddick legend with sequels and video games. But even a person who has only watched *Pitch Black* will likely come out of the movie with the impression of "badass", on their minds, which is likely only going to grow over time.



But is this an accurate representation of Riddick, and is it the reason that *Pitch Black* is a good movie and Riddick a great character?









He is not necessarily main character, he doesn't even have the most screen time. 

But, by the end of the film, there is no doubt that Riddick is the hero of this piece. And it is upon this foundation that the Riddick franchise was built, including multiple films, video games and even anime.

But, while ostensibly Riddick may have escaped the planet at the end of *Pitch Black*, in many ways his character, his character never did. 


With his first line of dialog, Riddick steals the movie right from under her.








Can Hollywood create a trilogy about a character that is anything less than a superhero responsible for saving the universe?

Popular films leave their audiences with a deep seated affection for their heroes. A sequel is the natural way to capitalise on this. But a character needs a bigger challenge on their second visit to the silver screen, which must once again be amplified for the third. This continues until the once beloved character bears no longer resemblance to his earlier self (See Jason X aka Jason in Space). 

Die Hard came close. The first three Die Hard films remain within the bounds of reality. However, things swiftly go downhill with Die Hard 4.0 (Live Free or Die Hard), with the character of John McLain being almost unrecognisable, as he is soon blowing up helicopters with cars and surfing jets (seriously not making this up, watch the movie). By the fifth film, the character simply has no limits anymore.

And it is these limits, that form focus of our discussion.







Who is this character who then goes on to describe, with remarkable detail, right down to the leather tool belt, his fellow passengers, presumably by smell alone?

 John McClane, begins his narrative journey as a police officer and deadbeat husband, a believable everyman who is thrust into events beyond his control. But before long, John McClane turns into John Rambo on steroids. In many ways, the Die Hard series achieved more than most, it was actually capable of putting together a solid trilogy before succumbing to inevitable Hollywood money making machine. 


??? Move the rest of this down to somewhere more appropriate.

While I am personally not a fan of Die Hard 2, by and large it remains believable (relatively speaking), and apart from a bit of nudging the fourth wall ("Why does this keep happening to us?", "Not again"), the characters remain in their own world. Die Hard: With a Vengance, does a much better job. By losing the fourth wall and pairing John up with an entertaining sidekick, Die Hard 3 feels like a perfect sequel. John is no more powerful than he was in Die Hard one, and his motivation and circumstances are believable.

But in a way what is most tragic about Die Hard 4.0 is that it is actually a great movie. It would have fit in perfectly as a Brosnan era Bond film, or some equally slapstick action flick. But it is not a good Die Hard film, because the character has no limits.

Die Hard is supposed to be about about a New York Cop, doing the best he can in the situation. In Die Hard, when terrorists attack Nakatomi Plaza, his first action, is to run away from danger. He then tries to call the police; the phone lines are cut. He then pulls the fire alarm, and the call is diverted. He then takes down ONE terrorist, and uses his radio to call for help. Once police assistance arrives, he hides in the bathroom, until he suddenly realises that the roof has been rigged with explosives, forcing him to try to save hostages.

At every junction his choices are quite logical and believable for his character. And this continues, by and large, for the next two films. But soon Hollywood require another movie, to capitalise on a much loved character, and quickly start looking around the back shelves for an action movie plot. 

Any will do, with a flick of a red pen John McLain quickly becomes a protagonist, complete with catchphrase and references to previous films. The fact that his character has suddenly become superhuman badass is irrelevant.



Our story begins aboard the Hunter Gratzner, where Richard B. Riddick is being transported in cryosleep back to the prison by bounty hunter William Johns. After a midflight incident, the pilot Carolyn Fry crash lands the ship on a planet. Their ship is badly damaged, but the soon find another ship with which they can escape the planet. But their troubles are not yet over, as the planet is infested with dangerous flying creatures and it is up to Riddick, Fry, Johns and the rest of the passengers to escape.
