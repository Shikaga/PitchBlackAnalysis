Pitch Black, Chronicles and why the Riddick franchise doesn't understand itself
---

"They say most of your brain shuts down in cryosleep. All but the primitive side. The animal side. No wonder I am still awake"

In the first twenty four words, Pitch Black tells you more about the character of Riddick than most films do in their entire three acts.

And yet, this is the very downfall of Riddick franchise. Pitch Black is a film about many characters, Riddick being just one of them, yet he is immediately set as the centre piece. 

In a film about Man vs the elements, Riddick plays just as big role as an elemental force as he does as a pivotal character.

But, by the end of the film, there is no doubt that Riddick is the hero of this piece. The fact that we know almost nothing about him makes him interesting to us. Who did he kill and why? Where did he learn to pilot, what is the secret behind those eyes of his?



Our story begins abord the Hunter Gratzner, where Richard B. Riddick is being transported in cryosleep back to the prison where he escaped from by bounty hunter William Johns. After a midflight incident, the pilot Carolyn Fry crash lands the ship on a planet. Their ship is badly damaged, but the soon find another ship with which they can escape the planet. But their troubles are not yet over, as the planet is infested with dangerous flying creatures and it is up to Riddick, Fry, Johns and the rest of the passengers to escape.

The Protagonist
---
Who is the protagonist of Pitch Black? Riddick, but it is not that simple. 

What do we expect from our protagonists? Courage, strength, intelligence? These are not traits that can best be applied to Riddick in this film.

Perhaps, all we need for someone to be a protagonist is for the audience to identify with them, to see the world from their point of view. Indeed, there are plenty of stories out there about anti-heroes, who we identify with and are undoubtedly the protagonists of their own films.

But can Riddick, who does not utter a single line of dialog for the first twenty seven minutes of the film, possibly be considered the film's protagonist?

In fact, for fully the first half of the movie, he plays the role the Xenomorph played in Alien.

Consider the parallels. 

In Alien, a [greedy crew member] brings a dangerous alien on board in an attempt to get rich. The Alien escapes, and then slowly hunts down each of the crew members in turn while the crew, headed by Ripley, try to track it down.

By contrast, in the first half of Pitch Black, John's brings a dangerous alien on board in an attempt to get rich. Riddick escapes, and then (we are lead to believe) slowly hunts down each of the crew members in turn while the crew, head by Fry, try to track him down.

A forced analogy? Maybe. But there is no question that in the first half of Pitch Black, before we truly understand the danger posed by the flying creatures, the audience is forced to see Riddick as the salient threat of the film.

It would not have been hard, for a writer to pick up the film after forty five minutes and turn it into a standard Freddy or Jason style slasher, with perhaps just one of the crew members escaping with the escape ship (with a cut of Riddick hiding in the engine bay for the stinger).

But this is not the direction the film chooses to take. It instead becomes much more interesting. Johns makes a deal with Riddick, help them, guide them, and he will get his freedom.

But before we discuss the rest of the film, let us look at the first act.

Warrant Officer First Class
---

This is unquestionably Carolyn Fry's movie. 

The film starts with her waking up from cryosleep in the midst of a disaster. While the her co-pilot Owens is still reeling from his sudden awakening, she is immediately into action, trying to land the ship.

She is then immediately confronted with a choice. With the ship crashing, she prepares to purge the passenger cabin. Owens talks her down, telling her that he has every confidence in her to be able to land the ship.

However, with ship still spinning out of control she attempts to purge the cabin anyway, but Owens has sabotaged the system, so that she is forced to try and land the ship intact.

It is at this point that we see the character Fry is, both in herself, and how she is reflected in Owens. 

She had the ability to land the ship, and Owens believes in her enough to entrust his own life into her hands. But she does not.

Is she merely being selfish, being willing to abandon people she doesn't know in a bid to save herself and her colleague? Perhaps, but she is also clearly pragmatic. She is is able to make the sacrifices to save those she can.

Once on the ground, she is happy to take order from Johns with regards to Riddick, but she takes charge of the passengers, searching for water and rescue. In fact, she also doesn't take any of Johns bullshit, calling him out when he starts trying to scare her with stories about Riddick. 

At this point, at the end of the first act, Fry is very much of a Ripley character. She is strong and independent, without being unlikable. 

But a film is made up of three acts.

The Xenomorph
---

With his first line of dialog, Riddick steals the movie right from under her.

Riddick is clearly the salient threat, the antagonist of a would be slasher film. Between his opening monologue and Johns doomsaying, we are given the impression that Riddick is a death dealing machine, that wouldn't hesitate to "skullfuck you in your sleep".

Even in chains in his opening dialogue exchange with Fry he is clearly in control. Of course, he has somehow been captured. But we have all been here before. The villain getting captured as part of his grand plan was a little less hacknied in 2000, but has always been a classic trope of genre films.

And yet, this never seems to come to pass. Did he know that Johns would relase him? Did he know that the only way that he would be able to get off the planet would be to travel with the rest of the passengers, allowing them to get picked off one by one, thus requiring him to get captured?

Indeed, it would not have been hard for to add a line of dialog for it to be so,

RIDDICK: "Come on Carolyn, do you think I helped you out of the goodness of my heart?" LAUGHS
Fry shakes her head, visibly upset.
RIDDICK: "I couldn't make it all the way myself, I needed a distraction. That's all you were to me Fry. Big, fat, juicy distractions" SMILES EVILY

And yet, this is not the Riddick that we are given in this movie? His role as antagonist does not outlive the first act. In fact, upon reflection, his actions of the first act are not conducive to an antagonist role when taken in context. Sure, he tried to incapacitate Johns in a bid to escape. But beyond that he doesn't seem to bear any ill will to any of the crewmembers, even Johns. 

His stalking of Fry seems to have been simply out of curiosity. He did not kill (the gravedigger).

The film definitely tries to give you the sense of his danger in the first act, but he never actually seems to provide a threat. 

That is not to say that he is a saint. He tries to help the others, but only to a degree. When one of the imam's boys gets cornered by a creature, Riddick does not try to save him. He tells the boy to stay still, but when the boy runs, Riddick does nothing to intervene, clearly sensing the futility of trying to save boy.

Johns in fact, posses a far more salient threat. Johns is completely selfish. We know this because he has a drug problem, and all junkies are evil. He was more than willing to kill Jack to save his own life, and he is fixing to betray Riddick from the moment that he frees him.

Even so by the end of Pitch Black, I can't help feeling that Riddick so completely fulfills both the Protagonist and Antagonist role perfectly.

But if I have just layed out a case showing that he should not be considered the antagonist of Pitch Black, why is that I feel this way?

It is because he performs acts that are unconcianable for a protagonist. When forced, he leaves Fry, Abu and Jack to die on the planet while he heads to safety. This is the actionas that we 

By fulfilling both protagonist and antagonist role, he can suddenly do no wrong in the eyes of the audience. We love him when he is good, and we love him all the more when he is bad.

Riddick is not without emotion, at least not in Pitch Black. 

He is prone to fits of anger. When Johns frees Riddick, he tells Riddick to "remember this moment. The way it could have gone and didn't". Riddick is visibly annoyed, and lashes out. He snatches Johns' rifle from his hand, "Fuck you!", he says threatening Johns', "I wan't you to remember this moment".

Riddick should have kept his cool, graciously accepted Johns' phony treaty and waited his time, but instead he tries, unsuccesfully, to restore the balance of power in his favour, posturing that merely earns a grin from Johns.

He is clearly a troubled individual. He talks about his disdain for God, the long time he spent in prison and the fact that his mother supposedly abandoned him at birth.

Riddick shows variable loyalty the rest of the crew. He clearly fancies himself as a stone cold killer, and tries to portray himself as such before the other characters. He delight's in their nievete, and laughs at their collective misfortune.

His ire fall's most heavily on Abu, The Holy Man. Riddick sees his belief as a weakness. "So where the hell's your God now?", he asks mockingly as the sudden rainfall starts to extinguish their last remaining torches.

But Riddick is not a sadist, or without reason. He does try to get the entire crew to safety. He defends Jack against Johns, when Johns tries to betray her, and he continues to shepard them through the valley of the shadow of death, almost literally.

The scene in which Fry arrives at the ship just in time to prevent Riddick from leaving without them is the climax of the film. It is where, we finally see precisely what our two main characters are made of. Each of them has made it to safety against incredible odds, and the prospect of going back for the remaining two survivors suddenly seems like an impossible task.

RIDDICK: "Strong survival instinct, I admire that in a woman"
FRY: "I promised them, that we would go back with more light"
RIDDICK: "Did you? Hmmm"
FRY: "What, are you afraid?"
RIDDICK: "Me afraid?" LAUGHING

By Riddick is afraid. He doesn't think that he can do. He already abandoned them once, when he decided to leave them at the last mile. Riddick is not a villian, he did not string his fellow passengers only to abandon them out of some kind of sadistic game. He truly believed he was too weak to save them, and his own survival instinct made him take the pragmatic approach.

When Fry tries to convince him to save the others, he simply counters with offering to take her with him, knowing it would be suicide, and that Fry is too clever to do otherwise.

"You don't know anything about me. I will leave you here"
"I can't. I can't" CRYING
"Sure you can, here I will make it easy on you

Riddick stretches out his hand

"Take my hand, Come on, Come one"
"Look, no one is going to blame you Carolyn"
"Come on, Come on, That's it, That's it. Good Girl"


He asks her to come aboard, offering his hand, and coaxing her onboard with gentle words and nudges, to overcome her emotional paralysis. This scene is truly incredible, Fry finally breaking down, weeping in the rain as she slowly resolves to leave the other to her face, while Riddick comforts her.

Fry's personal journey finally resolves. She determines that she would rather face death, even certain death, than leave any of her crew to die. She is able to rectify her mistake, to forgive herself for trying to purge the passenger hold.

"I am the captain of this ship..."

"You would die for them?"
"I would try for them"
"You didn't answer me"
"Yes I would Riddick, I would. I would die for them"

Riddick takes off his goggles. A beat

"How interesting"

It is in this moment that Riddick is a most interesting character. He has seen something that he can't explain. For Fry to selflessly go back for the others, even without Riddick's help intrigues him.

They save the other crew members, but Riddick is griviously hurt and alone, and it is subsequently Fry's responsibility to save him. 

FRY: "I said I would die for them. Not you"

Fry helps Riddick back to his feet, but while helping him back to the ship, she dies herself.

It is difficult to know what the character of Riddick feels at this moment. He seems to blame himself, but it is quite possible that he would let her take the blame for her own actions. He did warn her of the dangers of such a selfless act, and she declared that she was willing to die for them.


He allows himself a moment to grieve, but once again, he tries to embody his persona of "stone cold killer", by the time that he once again joins the rest of the crew. What this says about his character, is as much a reflection of viewers feeling as Riddick's, but it is clear that he is not unnaffected by her death.


Nor is he an unstoppable killing machine. Indeed, in this regard, in the Chronicles of Riddick it seems like he is a completely different character. 

In pitch black he is frequently bested by the rest of crew. When he first escapes, John's is able to take him down, despite Riddick getting the drop on him (albeit, while shackled). And after he escapes, he is once again captured by crew, when they work together.

Nor does he have the usual prescience of a movie hero. He frequently misjudges both his enemies and his allies. When cornered by the creatures, he runs towards the rest of the crew, not predicting that they would instinctively shine light in his eyes. I have almost never seen such a trivial mistake made by a movie hero, and it imbues Riddick with a certain sense of believablity.

"It lookes clear"


In addition, we can assume that John's was able to track down and capture Riddick by his skill as a bounty hunter.

Not only that, but he is beaten to the point of near unconciousness by a mere two creatures, who have already shown themselves to not be particularly dangerous, relatively speaking. He needs Fry to save him after his battle, and is so weak, that he is not even capable of saving her.

By contrast, the Riddick presented to us in Chronicles, is an unstoppable killing machine, who is able to take down crew after crew of highly skilled mercenaries unarmed, dangerous convicts with nothing more tin cup and necromancer Gods with a simple dagger.

He infiltrates Crematoria without any apparent doubt that not only he but also Jack will be able to subsequently break out. Yet in Riddick states that he spent half of his life in his previous "slam". In fact, we are informed that he was only able to escape by hijacking a prison transport, we have no reason to believe that he is a man that no prison can hold. 

This is sadly one of the common mistakes that all sequels seem to be prone to. Once your hero has defeated one enemy, they need to be given a bigger test. This is why a New York City cop who's initial actions are initially to call the police, is only three movies later blowing up a helicopter with a car and surfing a jet.

It seems impossible for films to let a character be anything less than a superhero by the time their second movie comes around. Even Alien is not completely immune to this, with with the Ripley from Aliens being significantly more badass than her previous incarnation.

That is not to say that the Riddick presented in Pitch Black is weak. He shows himself to be supremely competent, but he never quite stops being human. 






There are many comparisons to be made with Alien. Both film's feature largely on female protagonists. Both movies involve getting stalked in the dark by aliens. Both movies feature largely civilian crew members. 

"Don't you touch that handle Fry!"

What was it that made Pitch Black much better than The Chronicles of Riddick? It is so easy to chalk it up to Chronicles being yet another "unnecessary sequels", that w
