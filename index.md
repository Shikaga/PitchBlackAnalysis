Antihero: Why the Riddick franchise doesn't understand itself
=============================================================

Introduction
============

*Pitch Black* is science-fiction horror film starring Vin Diesel. It has all the elements of a classic survival horror flick: A tough guy, a villain, lethal monsters and, of course, a disparate group of survivors waiting to be killed for the viewing pleasure of the audience. And, of course, above all this one element stands out in the film: the character of Richard B. Riddick.
