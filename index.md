Pitch Black, Alien and why the Riddick franchise doesn't understand itself
---

"They say most of your brain shuts down in cryosleep. All but the primitive side. The animal side. No wonder I am still awake"

In the first twenty four words, Pitch Black tells you more about the character of Riddick than most films do in their entire three acts.

And yet, this is the very downfall of Riddick franchise. This opening monologue sets Riddick as the centrepiece of a film that he does not necessarily star in. Pitch Black is a film about many characters, Riddick being just one of them.

But, by the end of the film, there is no doubt that Riddick is the hero of this piece. The fact that we know almost nothing about him makes him interesting to us. Who did he kill and why? Where did he learn to pilot, what is the secret behind those eyes of his?



Our story begins abord the Hunter Gratzner, where Richard B. Riddick is being transported in Cryosleep back to the prison where he escaped from by bounty hunter William Johns. After unfortunate midflight incident, the pilot Carolyn Fry crash lands the ship on a planet. They find a ship with which they can escape the planet, but the planet is not safe, infested with dangerous flying creatures and it is up to Riddick, Fry, Johns and the rest of the passengers and crew to escape.


There are many comparisons to be made with Alien. Both film's feature largely on female protagonists. Both movies involve getting stalked in the dark by aliens. Both movies feature largely civilian crew members. 

"Don't you touch that handle Fry!"

What was it that made Pitch Black much better than The Chronicles of Riddick? It is so easy to chalk it up to Chronicles being yet another "unnecessary sequels", that w

The Protagonist

Who is the protagonist of Pitch Black? What a silly question you say, Riddick of course!

Well, maybe. He is after all, the most memorable character. Everyone walks out of the film, thinking "Man, that Riddick was a badass!", and it is true that he is.

But while Riddick may be the protagonist, he is simulataneously also the antagonist. And this is where the character of Riddick becomes most interesting.

By fulfilling both protagonist and antagonist role, he can suddenly do no wrong in the eyes of the audience. We love him when he is good, and we love him all the more when he is bad.

But let me propose an alternative. Consider that perhaps Fry is the protagonist.

In many ways, this makes more sense. Indeed, Fry is very much of a Ripley character. She is competent, strong, treated as an equal by the rest of her crew. She is also eminently pragmatic. 

The opening scene in which she attempts to purge the passenger cabin. Owens has every confidence that she is able to save everyone on board, even though Fry does not.

Riddick

Twenty seven minutes. This is how long it is before Riddick has his first line of dialogue.

And yet, everyone 

Yes of course, Riddick. He is what we all came here to see isn't it?

Well, no. At least, not in 2000 when Pitch Black was released. Sure, he is what we all left the cinema remember, but he was not the reason we came to see the movie. In the painfully nineties trailer, Riddick is as an incidental character at best.

Riddick is not without emotion, at least not in Pitch Black. 

He is prone to fits of anger. When Johns frees Riddick, he tells Riddick to "remember this moment. The way it could have gone and didn't". Riddick is visibly annoyed, and lashes out. He snatches Johns' rifle from his hand, "Fuck you!", he says threatening Johns', "I wan't you to remember this moment".

Riddick should have kept his cool, graciously accepted Johns' phony treaty and waited his time, but instead he tries, unsuccesfully, to restore the balance of power in his favour, posturing that merely earns a grin from Johns.

He is clearly a troubled individual. He talks about his disdain for God, the long time he spent in prison and the fact that his mother supposedly abandoned him at birth.

Riddick shows variable loyalty the rest of the crew. He clearly fancies himself as a stone cold killer, and tries to portray himself as such before the other characters. He delight's in their nievete, and laughs at their collective misfortune.

His ire fall's most heavily on Abu, The Holy Man. Riddick sees his belief as a weakness. "So where the hell's your God now?", he asks mockingly as the sudden rainfall starts to extinguish their last remaining torches.

But Riddick is not a sadist, or without reason. He does try to get the entire crew to safety. He defends Jack against Johns, when Johns tries to betray her, and he continues to shepard them through the valley of the shadow of death, almost literally.

The scene in which Fry arrives at the ship just in time to prevent Riddick from leaving without them is the climax of the film. It is where, we finally see precisely what our two main characters are made of. Each of them has made it to safety against incredible odds, and the prospect of going back for the remaining two survivors suddenly seems like an impossible task.

RIDDICK: "Strong survival instinct, I admire that in a woman"
FRY: "I promised them, that we would go back with more light"
RIDDICK: "Did you? Hmmm"
FRY: "What, are you afraid?"
RIDDICK: "Me afraid?" LAUGHING

By Riddick is afraid. He doesn't think that he can do. He already abandoned them once, when he decided to leave them at the last mile. Riddick is not a villian, he did not string his fellow passengers only to abandon them out of some kind of sadistic game. He truly believed he was too weak to save them, and his own survival instinct made him take the pragmatic approach.

When Fry tries to convince him to save the others, he simply counters with offering to take her with him, knowing it would be suicide, and that Fry is too clever to do otherwise.

"You don't know anything about me. I will leave you here"
"I can't. I can't" CRYING
"Sure you can, here I will make it easy on you

Riddick stretches out his hand

"Take my hand, Come on, Come one"
"Look, no one is going to blame you Carolyn"
"Come on, Come on, That's it, That's it. Good Girl"


He asks her to come aboard, offering his hand, and coaxing her onboard with gentle words and nudges, to overcome her emotional paralysis. This scene is truly incredible, Fry finally breaking down, weeping in the rain as she slowly resolves to leave the other to her face, while Riddick comforts her.

Fry's personal journey finally resolves. She determines that she would rather face death, even certain death, than leave any of her crew to die. She is able to rectify her mistake, to forgive herself for trying to purge the passenger hold.

"I am the captain of this ship..."

"You would die for them?"
"I would try for them"
"You didn't answer me"
"Yes I would Riddick, I would. I would die for them"

Riddick takes off his goggles. A beat

"How interesting"

It is in this moment that Riddick is a most interesting character. He has seen something that he can't explain. For Fry to selflessly go back for the others, even without Riddick's help intrigues him.

They save the other crew members, but Riddick is griviously hurt and alone, and it is subsequently Fry's responsibility to save him. 

FRY: "I said I would die for them. Not you"

Fry helps Riddick back to his feet, but while helping him back to the ship, she dies herself.

It is difficult to know what the character of Riddick feels at this moment. He seems to blame himself, but it is quite possible that he would let her take the blame for her own actions. He did warn her of the dangers of such a selfless act, and she declared that she was willing to die for them.


He allows himself a moment to grieve, but once again, he tries to embody his persona of "stone cold killer", by the time that he once again joins the rest of the crew. What this says about his character, is as much a reflection of viewers feeling as Riddick's, but it is clear that he is not unnaffected by her death.


Nor is he an unstoppable killing machine. Indeed, in this regard, in the Chronicles of Riddick it seems like he is a completely different character. 

In pitch black he is frequently bested by the rest of crew. When he first escapes, John's is able to take him down, despite Riddick getting the drop on him (albeit, while shackled). And after he escapes, he is once again captured by crew, when they work together.

Nor does he have the usual prescience of a movie hero. He frequently misjudges both his enemies and his allies. When cornered by the creatures, he runs towards the rest of the crew, not predicting that they would instinctively shine light in his eyes. I have almost never seen such a trivial mistake made by a movie hero, and it imbues Riddick with a certain sense of believablity.

"It lookes clear"


In addition, we can assume that John's was able to track down and capture Riddick by his skill as a bounty hunter.

Not only that, but he is beaten to the point of near unconciousness by a mere two creatures, who have already shown themselves to not be particularly dangerous, relatively speaking. He needs Fry to save him after his battle, and is so weak, that he is not even capable of saving her.

By contrast, the Riddick presented to us in Chronicles, is an unstoppable killing machine, who is able to take down crew after crew of highly skilled mercenaries unarmed, dangerous convicts with nothing more tin cup and necromancer Gods with a simple dagger.

He infiltrates Crematoria without any apparent doubt that not only he but also Jack will be able to subsequently break out. Yet in Riddick states that he spent half of his life in his previous "slam". In fact, we are informed that he was only able to escape by hijacking a prison transport, we have no reason to believe that he is a man that no prison can hold. 

This is sadly one of the common mistakes that all sequels seem to be prone to. Once your hero has defeated one enemy, they need to be given a bigger test. This is why a New York City cop who's initial actions are initially to call the police, is only three movies later blowing up a helicopter with a car and surfing a jet.

It seems impossible for films to let a character be anything less than a superhero by the time their second movie comes around. Even Alien is not completely immune to this, with with the Ripley from Aliens being significantly more badass than her previous incarnation.

That is not to say that the Riddick presented in Pitch Black is weak. He shows himself to be supremely competent, but he never quite stops being human.
